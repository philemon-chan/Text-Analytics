I will say the chair, and bar stools are not the most comfortable, but I decided to eat and drink more, which made me forget about that. We decided to order several different items to share in hopes of ordering an entrée to split.  However, the items were so large that we couldn't even finish what we had ordered.  The deviled eggs, pickles, and poutine were delicious but I don't really understand the insanely large portion. We would have continued to order items, but the portions are way too much, and I could tell by looking around no one ate everything on their plates, which is such a waste.  I would definitely recommend checking this place out even with the large portions, but just keep that in mind when ordering.",105,296,2,0,1,4

We got the fried pickles to start and some aviation gin and tonics. The fried pickles weres perfect, I just wish they gave more of them! The bartender was nice and funny since we were talking about the aviation gin (by Ryan Reynolds).We got the Mac and cheese to share and it was really creamy. I got the mushroom biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs (forgot to take a pic). I was excited to try a vegetarian gravy since no places really have that! It was pretty good but I've had better biscuits.My boyfriend got the fried chicken with sausage and he said the chicken was crispy and the gravy was good too. He also thought the biscuits weren't the best he's had. I definitely want to come back and try some other stuff. Love the vibe of the place too!",2,33,0,0,0,4

We started at the bar until everyone arrived. We had an appetizer of the deviled eggs. Very good. We had predinner cocktails.  The Spicy Brine Margarita was DELICIOUS!! Loved it. The perfect blend.For dinner I had the fried chicken thigh basket with the collard greens and grits. I enjoyed everything except the grits.  They were cooked perfect but the cheddar cheese they used is not tasty at all. The collard greens were the BOMB!! I should have gotten a double of those greens.My other guests got catfish tacos, the jacob patty melt and the bbq chicken smothered pepper jack entrees. They also all enjoyed.The service was also good. Attentive and friendly.  But I want to highlight my favorite part of the night which was the music.  It was awesome. Created the perfect vibe and ambiance. We were there 4 hours and didn't even realize it.I would definitely come back. I highly recommend anyone to stop by and give Jacob's Pickles a try.",169,114,3,3,0,4

The wait is always long and seems especially long while watching people eat while standing in the cold, but it is well worth it. I can't remember having one thing here that I have been disappointed with. Servers are always warm, helpful, and courteous. Food comes out really quickly and the portions are big enough for two people to share. I mean, I do have to stop myself from eating it all by myself so it just depends on how hungry you are that day. Great for brunch and dinner. Diverse beer selection for the type of place it is and it has something for everyone. Warning though, calorie conscious folks might have a problem or two sticking to your plan here. Don't tempt yourself.... or do, like I did.Will be back. Good place to bring family and friends visiting NYC.",289,113,1,1,0,4
oxIiccWmIvf8spyL30cYRi,kBgtoQFF0j1O9qgVcEKAiw,xt4sa64WOrpJvZBDPNPNYg,2019-11-16,4,"Likes: even though coming in with high expectations, the tastes and quality of the food were still too good to be true. I am usually not someone who particularly seeks out for southern food, but everything here is deliiiiiish, from the savoriness and crispiness of the chicken wings, the perfect moist and rich taste of the corn bread, to the millions of dipping sauces that are offered on the table. I see why people would wait for hours just to have a bit of it.Hopes for improvement: wish they have a better way to organize the wait list. The gentleman at the check in mistakenly marked our party as incomplete, which resulted in us waiting for at least 30 minutes more than we should have, only to notice afterwards that many who have come after us were seated before us. The gentleman only never gave us any updates and we had to go in line to talk to him multiple times to make things clear.",18,73,1,0,0,4

There were already a bunch of patrons ready to be seated and fed. This was a big indicator to me that the food would be great and also that as the day progressed there would be a bit of wait to get seated. Since we were there so early we got seated right away. The food was exactly as I expected it to be. Delicious and soulful! We ordered the chicken and pancakes (a different spin on chicken and waffles) which was so yummy and fulfilling. We also got the croque madame, which is enough to share among 2 people! It was perfect and cheesy! The customer service was just right. I will certainly be going back for brunch and dinner.",249,44,2,2,0,4

It's made with vodka and cranberry cinnamon simple syrup that's made in house!For our appetizers, we got the Biscuits & Fixins and the Deviled Eggs.The biscuits came with Strawberry Preserves, Orange Preserves, and Clover Honey in cute little squeeze bottles and small tubs of salted butter and maple butter. The pickled mustard seeds were a nice addition to the deviled eggs.  We ordered the Shrimp & Grits, classic Mac & Cheese, and Hot Chicken Biscuit. The shrimp and grits had a nice smokey crayfish flavor in the sauce. It's a delicious dish, but note that the shrimp comes with the shells on.The classic mac & cheese was great! Cheesy and creamy - just what I expect and love about mac and cheese. The hot chicken biscuit was a good dish, but not spectacular. The spicy hot chicken flavor did not come through and the biscuit was a tad dry. Overall, this was a great meal! The winners were definitely the Deviled Eggs and the Autumn Blush cocktail.",235,32,1,0,0,4

My two friends and I came on a Saturday morning and luckily there was not a wait. This is a really ideal place for an indulgent brunch without all the frills and stuck up atmosphere that you'd find at other places but with HUGE portions for a decent price.My friends and I ordered three dishes (croque madam, bacon egg chicken biscuit, and southern chicken biscuit) as well as an ice coffee and the total came out to be around $75 in total with tax and tip. However the portions were HUGE. You should definitely come with a group of friends and go family style or be prepared to go home with a lot of leftovers (I only managed to eat a 1/3 of my croque madam) but my guy friends managed to finish 3/4 to all of their plates! I think for value, I really liked the croque madam because I got to enjoy their infamous fried chicken and biscuit but also have my egg and ham. Plus I much preferred potatoes to grits. The fried tomatoes were so so on my friend's southern chicken biscuit but the table next to us got this lovely pumpkin biscuit special which I'd love to try next time. It does get a bit loud in the back as the quarters are tight but it wasn't unbearable.",728,197,2,2,0,4

Fried chicken with sausage gravy 5 STARS ALL DAY LONG!Super crowded all day and night during the weekends. Don't be afraid - it's totally worth the wait. Hamburger Mac and Cheese - next level. Totally enough for two. Totally enough for a post hangover gut bomb for two. Ribs fall off the bone. Perfectly slow cooked / smoked with insane bbq sauce. Sever with a baked potato smothered in buttery cheesy bacony goodness. The slaw is next level. Maybe best slaw I've ever had. Skip the brussel sprouts. The bartenders rock. The place is always packed but they make eye contact with everyone and get you your drink quick. Get the fried chicken and sausage gravy. It will change your life.

When we got the text, we had literally 5 minutes to get back to the restaurant or we'd lose our spot. No confirmation to secure our table, which is kind of ridiculous. I guess that's how businesses are now a days when they are so popular. We didn't make it in time, but luckily the person behind us also didn't show up so we were able to get a table. They had given us a table outside, and would be with us in a second. They didn't even give us a menu. When the waiter finally came around, he wondered if we just sat down from off the street since we didn't have a menu - such a strange place. When we finally got the menu, we ordered 2 appetizers -- street corn and fried pickles. I also got the mushroom gravy smothered chicken sandwich.I would say the appetizers aren't worth it. It was good to try, but it isn't a good value for how much you get. The chicken is what was really good. I think that is the most satisfying part of the meal. It is a lot of food. I ended up taking it to go -- though it was a long process. Overall, the service is really slow. I think I would come more often if it wasn't a whole day thing.",265,330,0,0,0,4

The vibe was really nice for dates. The dim lights and music were perfect to have intimate conversations while having privacy from tables close by. The appetizer we got was the fried pickles, which were light and crispy. The only down side was that they didn't have enough for me to gobble up but....The entrees were HUGE.

Felt like we were all squished together and everyone had to yell to hear the other people in their party. As for the food, the fried chicken (honey fried chicken biscuit) was super crispy and delightful for the first few bites. And then I guess the honey sank in and the rest of the chicken became soggy. Flavor was very yummy at least!If I come back again, it'll be with a reservation and will definitely ask for honey/dressings on the side.",44,106,2,1,1,4

I'd say it lives up to the hype! I was lucky enough to go on a weekday for lunch, when there is absolutely no wait. I got the southern BLT biscuit and fried chicken entree. The chicken was extra crispy, sauce was delicious, and it was slathered with really good cole slaw! The cheesy grits that paired with it were really good as well. The biscuits weren't too dry and absorbed the sauce, Cole slaw, and chicken really well.Great meal as a cheat day and to indulge.

The place was surly busy on this fall Saturday, but we were seated immediately. Our waiter was very pleasant and knowledgeable on the menu as we expressed it was our first time. She shared the specials for the day and gave us a heads up that the servings for entrees were large portions (more like huge) which def makes it great for your money. We had the fried pickles and 2 buttermilk biscuits with the ""works"" as starters. Entree were the Chicken and Pancakes and the Jacobs Patty melt. OH MY! The patty melt came on a lunch sized tray loaded with fries cooked to my request. The pancakes were huge and fluffy and 2 beautiful sized pieces of chicken. We enjoyed the presentation and then the flavor and then were intimated by the size that we couldn't finish haha. Def would want to come back to try their brunch and more beer options. I'm no pickle lover, but if you love that def give Jacobs a spin for your fix too. Overall, good customer service, quick turnaround with food, good ambiance and clean space.

After the walk, they get brunch and tell me all about it. Hello? Where is the invite? One day, I decided to join my friends afterwards around 9 am. The minute I got there, there was already a line. They opened at 9 am and already a line. That already said a lot about the place. My friends and I got two orders of hot fried chicken and shared it. OH MY LORD! I literally found myself greedily grabbing more chicken before I finished the one on my plate. The dish comes with two large juicy chicken pieces perfectly fried after it has been brined in pickle juice and buttermilk. Then, it is doused with a hot sauce elixir that makes the already delicious chicken fabulous! Just when you think things can't get better, they top the chicken with a mound of thinly sliced pickles and serve creamy grits and biscuits on the side. Do yourself a favor and forget about the biscuit/ grits. Yes, they are good, but the chicken is the star and, Jesus Christmas, it is the best fried chicken I ever had. Actually, let's bring the grits/ biscuit back because the hot sauce needs something to sop it up. The thing I like about this dish is that the pickles cut into the greasey/ oily fried chicken so you don't feel so heavy afterwards. It gives you an illusion of lightness, but don't be fooled, it is not. I had this last Sunday and I am already craving it already. My friend took the leftover bits home and I thought she was silly because there wasn't much left, but.... I was a fool. I should have fought her for the bit. So I am on a plane on my way to New Orleans and as I was boarding the plane, I was telling my friend how I wished I had the chicken before we left the city and the lady in front of us was like ""Jacob's Pickle? I love that place!"" We instantly became friends. When you know, you know. BUT! One thing, I got a side of pickled eggs because I thought about my friend's mom who makes bomb pickled eggs. Don't get it. It is a bit off... Hot chicken dish! You will think of me and scatter rose petals wherever I walk for giving you the best advice of all time. For the first time in forever I was excited about a dish. Being a foodie obsessed with how things are made and just having a very particular preference, it is really hard to get me excited about certain things, but this one. Wow! ALSO! After this, we got Levain bakery cookies so.... our day really couldn't go wrong even if we got hit by the car.",37,163,1,2,2,4

Luckily, my Chicago pal, Mel B. helped with this one.The place is easy to get to, and minimally stylish. As with most places in the city, expect to be close to your neighbors; space is a premium.The menu is wonderful, just a variety of things to choose from. They're known for their pickles, the table next to us had an interesting selection, but we'd already stopped at a bakery before breakfast so I knew this wasn't the day for appetizers. I'll certainly give em a go on the next trip.I enjoyed the bacon, egg & cheese biscuit. As you can see by the pic, it's the size of the plate! It's locally sourced, I appreciate that. The bacon is thick-sliced, and smoky--perfect against the creamy texture of the eggs, and the mild buttermilk flavor of the biscuit.The service was perfection, never an empty coffee cup along with great recommendations.

Food was good and expectedly very heavy, however I wasn't impressed.  The food comes out barely warm. I liked their biscuits by itself, the gravy is tasty but I didn't really care for it, but that's a matter of preference as my husband really enjoyed it. Fried pickles are good. Now the hot chicken biscuit sandwich, the chicken was seasoned and fried well but the sauce this dish uses was very oily and it made the biscuit underneath too greasy to eat. The cheddar grits it came with was awfully gelatinous. I would try a different chicken sandwich next time and hopefully this was just a bad batch of grits.

Although we sat down at the large communal table, the spots next to us eventually cleared up. The waiter was really nice in explaining what specials they had, the popular items they have on the menu, and warming us that the portion sizes are pretty big. I'm glad he did because the 3 dishes that we had got were enough for the 4 of us to feel stuffed but happy when we left the restaurant.We ordered the French toast, Croque Madame, and the Sausage Gravy Chicken Biscuit. Each of these dishes had a unique flavor profile to itself, despite having a biscuit in every dish. I've never had a French Toast biscuit before but this was a game changer. The dish already had 4 different pieces of French toast. The outside was nice and crunch with a light sugar powdering, topped with a nice serving of strawberries. Their syrup they have on the table also wasn't too sweet so I didn't feel like it over powered the other flavors. The Croque Madame was huge! The stacked fried egg over the ham, friend buttermilk chicken, over a biscuit with amazing sauce was super delicious. It was a little bit salty, but the flavors really matched. The biscuit they utilized in this dish also had bacon bits cooked within it. This dish also comes with circular cut potatoes, some are thin so it's crunch like a chip but some of the other ones still had the fluffy potato texture.The last dish, the sausage gravy chicken biscuit, is definitely a super comfort food. The gravy itself was rich in flavor and paired well with the spices in the buttermilk chicken. I'm typically not a fan of grits but the way they mixed the cheese into the grits made it really delicious. I would definitely come back here to try their pickles and beer. They have a really amazing selection on the menu that I'm dying to try.",330,43,0,0,0,4

It's close to my boyfriend's new apartment and we were hungry so we took the gamble. We came on a Saturday night, right around peak dinner time. Surprisingly, we were seated right away. First and foremost, the food is b.o.m.b [makes bomb sound effects]. I had the Honey Chicken Biscuit [$17] which comes with cheese grits. The farms they source their chickens from must have a workout regime. The piece of buttermilk fried chicken was the biggest I've seen in my life. While it was huge, it was also cooked expertly. It was incredibly juicy on the inside and fried to crispy perfection on the outside. The biscuit it came on, oh boy, that was a flakey, buttery biscuit. Lest I forget, the cheese grits tasted like Thanksgiving mashed potatoes minus the tryptophan-induced coma. This dish is literally all I can think about a few weeks later. My boyfriend had the Chicken & Pancakes [$19]. He said he likes a version of this dish better at The Common in Brooklyn. Idk...his opinion doesn't count [I'm the worst]. I also had a cider, Graft Salt & Sand [$9], which is fruity and acidic. It's nice to drink something refreshing while eating something rich and heavy. He had the root beer, which he enjoyed. I do not like root beer. ___Unfortunately, the air conditioner was not working. It was humid outside and not much better inside, even with the fans blowing. The cooling system dripped on our table as well as the table next to ours. It didn't seem like anyone cared all too much. In any event, we got a free shower. Lucky that my boyfriend and I have been together for awhile. The restaurant is loud and we wouldn't be able to hear each other even if we wanted to. Service wasn't the most attentive as it was busy. This is definitely not somewhere you want to go on a first date, unless you do not plan on a second one. Come only if you can sit in awkward silence with your significant other and only want to shove friend chicken in your mouth unabashed.Our meal was incredibly affordable- $64 after tax and tip.

I ordered the Honey Fried Chicken and Pickles and it was enormous. The whole plate was more than enough for two meals. It doesn't just have one piece of fried chicken, but rather two generous slabs, sandwiched between two soft pieces of honey-soaked corn bread. The pickles have a sweet brine and have just a hint of sour to them. After savoring the crispy sweetness of my biscuit sandwich, I found myself admitting defeat and packing most of it to go. The side of cheesy grits also comes in a generous portion, but I don't like grits much and couldn't get on board with them. Even so, this was definitely a meal to remember!",420,164,0,0,0,4

Not that the Southern BLT is bad, but it just had a little too much going on and lacked flavor (which is why I knocked off a star). The hot chicken, however, was simple (in the sense that it was ""just"" chicken, hot sauce, and pickles) and had a LOT more flavor.

While we took turns using the restroom (because we all wanted to finished our drinks as well) this manager made a point of casting is mean looks at us and came over to the table 2 additional times to say that there was a reservation for that table and we needed to leave.

The entrees at Jacob's Pickles were great and I would still highly recommend the place. I had the sausage gravy smothered fried chicken and it was phenomenal. The grits that came as the side were pretty plain and nothing to rave about. My girlfriend had the cheeseburger mac which was also very good (and literally a full cast iron skillet's-worth)Can confirm the portions are massive! Working backwards though, things start going downhill. We tried the deviled eggs and the fried pickles for apps, and they weren't very good. The pickles were way to thinly sliced and all you could taste was the breading. The deviled eggs had a huge amount of yolk (both on top and a bed of it underneath) that was just too much, and it had a gritty texture. When we arrived we were told there would be a 35 minute wait, and recieved a text message after waiting about that long. However, when you are texted and go to the hosts, they have you wait off to the side until your table is actually ready.

We chose to wait, but at this point have been waiting for over an hour total and are stuck in this terrible spot, becoming frustrated. Why can't people wait outside after they have been texted? We waited an hour and 15 minutes in total to be seated, compared to the 35 minutes we were originally told. I know it's tough to estimate these things, but ths 35 minutes wasn't for our own table and never should have been told to us without noting that. Waiting in the cramped space for about a half hour was also a terrible experience and certainly doesnt help the wait staff Luckily it was worth it for the amazing entree, but my girlfriend and I were frustrated and impatient by the time we were seated.

We enjoyed the deviled eggs, fried pickles, and special sours, although nothing to write home about. I ordered the cheeseburger Mac, which was HUGE. Felt like two boxes of pasta, to be honest. Definitely didn't even make a dent, but it was good. Boyfriend's fried chicken / biscuit with sausage gravy was great. He housed it and I enjoyed the few bites he allowed me :)Drinks were alright, would've loved some brine flights or something more creative, but they were good. All in all, highs and lows.

We got drinks at the bar and were given a seat at a  'communal table' after about 35 minutes which was honestly the worst part. The table was super packed and you're literally rubbing tables with a stranger...I got over it after my second spicy pickle margarita. For starters, we shared the deviled eggs and the fried pickles. The eggs were amazing and the pickles were fried to perfection and the pickles super juicy. For mains I had the hot chicken biscuit and my friend had the fried chicken Cesar. The hot chicken was the perfect amount of spicy and came with cheesy grits (I didn't think I liked grits but I guess I do now). The fried chicken salad is definitely not a diet salad, huge chunks of fried chicken and Parmesan biscuits make it such a indulgent salad. Will definitely be back.

To describe the Mac n Cheese, my husband said, ""You know how there are some meals where one bit is better than another? Every single bite of this stuff is amazing."" It's flavor is spot on and the portion is HUGE! We ordered the smaller size and it could have easily fed both of us.The Honey Chicken and Pickles sandwich was to die for.

I've been coming to Joe's since they first opened at Pell Street as a child with my family. Tonight we were surprised at the upgraded restaurant and decor, a big change from the dingy restaurant we've been going to for 20+ years. Everything is new and cleaner looking and the high ceilings and decorative wood decor make this place much more comfortable. Gone are the majority of the large tables which often had   four or more different parties crammed in, replaced by more sensible square tables of 2 or 4 for a more private dining experience. Gone are also the opportunities to chat with tourists and reach across the table to share a bite or two of each other's dish.Is it better? Hard to say. It's definitely more comfortable and LOOKS cleaner. The soup dumplings, the ones we've been eating for 20+ years and what defined my idea of a soup dumpling growing up, has changed somewhat. The skin is thicker (though I have argued it has been thicker for a few years now), the broth thinner with less lip sticking collagen and fat, and the overall soup dumpling (all 4 of the orders we placed) was lukewarm at best, not the same tongue scalding hot as they were at Pell Street. Not sure if this was an opening night fluke or if this will be permanent. Prices are the same as the Pell Street location as it should be since Joe's recently went through significant price hikes a few years ago bringing a regular soup dumpling from $4.95 to $7.95.Scallion pancake also had doubled in price but not quantity or quality and while the fried rice remains the same price, it looks like they changed to smaller serving plates. The szechuan beef noodle soup, never actually spicy, has been put into a larger bowl now. I asked for them to make it extra spicy to get a hint of spice but even that came with a touch of off-putting sweetness. Veggies, particularly snow pea leaves, are deep fried and extremely overpriced for the portion. Recommend everyone stay far away from the vegetables section and eat those elsewhere. Overall the new location looks nice but was not impressed with tonight's soup dumplings or most of the other food. Hope it is just a fluke as they are getting used to the new space and kitchens.P. S. Mandatory tip has now increased from 15% to 18% regardless of party size. Service has improved slightly. Tea and oranges are still free (for now). CASH ONLY",29,81,5,0,1,4

The steamed pork dumplings, despite being $10, really mimicked the ones you could get in a bulk bag at the grocery store. Served with vinegar, it didn't taste bad, but it definitely wasn't super fresh nor mindblowing. I will admit, the soup dumplings were far better and definitely the redeeming factor. They were massive in size and were piping hot and fresh.

The utensils also did not seem that clean, and there were some cracks and chips on my plate, but I guess if you're going here, you came for the food.  There are only round tables that seat 8 people and due to their limited space, they will put strangers next to you if your table is not filled. Fortunately, the servers are very efficient and super quick. We only ordered one item, which was the pork soup dumplings. They came out super hot and were a great value, you get 8 pieces for $8.00 (Cash Only). The soup dumplings tasted just like the authentic ones I had in China.

The soup is so flavorful and is a little thicker than what I expected. Tasted more like chicken broth, quite oily as well. But sooo worth it! The dumplings costs around $10. They're not stingy with the crab either but be careful when eating this because there might be some shell still in the meat mixture. I crunched on a few. The dumplings of course come with the vinegar soy sauce and ginger as well as chili sauce which had a sour taste to me. We also ordered the pan fried noodles. Light and airy noodles that pop in your mouth with that perfect crunch topped with the thick gravy sauce packed with napa cabbage, your choice of meat, and bean spouts. That being said, the line isn't really worth the wait. We came around on a weekday 1.5 hr before closing so we didn't have a wait.

Saturday afternoon, was able to get a seat at a large communal table without any wait. Most of the main dishes are on the expensive side as they are family-style. Since I didn't have a family with me, I opted instead for the Spring Roll ($2.75) and the Pork Soup Dumplings ($8). While waiting, you are served green tea that's piping hot and good for the stomach. Spring roll is served with a side of soy sauce and stuffed with shrimp and pork. Found it to be overly greasy and not well balanced. The flavor of the shrimp was the saving grace. Soup dumplings come shortly after, several steamed pieces served with soy sauce and ginger. Again, flavor is a little dull - could have used some more spices for the added kick. Towards the last few the dumplings got much colder, so didn't finish the last two.Servers come around often to make sure they get people in and out quickly.

The ratio of soup to pork was spot on and each bite was better than the last. My only issue with their product is the dumpling sauce, this is purely personal.....  I'd love a bit of vinegar in there for some tang, but that's hardly a blight on a near perfect dumpling experience.

Only even had it bookmarked because my friend recommended it. I come from the land of amazing Chinese food (see: San Gabriel Valley) and NY isn't exactly renowned for amazing Asian food. But even I have to admit there's only so much pizza a guy can eat before he gets tired of it.Came here around 4 pm on a Saturday afternoon. There was a HUGE crowd of people outside, and I wasn't about to wait longer than 15 minutes to sit down. Thankfully, since I was by myself, I didn't have to wait. Sat down immediately at a shared table, I guess that's just how they do it here with the lack of significant dining space.I only got one thing, the pork meat soup dumplings or xiao long bao. They don't look pretty at all, but they are solid and on par with some of the places back home. They definitely bring the soup in soup dumplings. Trying to eat one of these bad boys in one bite was not a good idea between how big each dumpling was and how hot the soup inside each dumpling was. Pork was fairly run-of-the-mill, nothing overly memorable. Overall, not bad.Service was actually pretty decent for a Chinese place. They're very VERY motivated on one thing, getting you in and out as soon as possible so that they can sit the next party. Joe's is very well-staffed though, so getting someone's attention is not very difficult. And they all speak English, given how many non-Asians pass through here. So yeah, the service is better than your average Chinese place.Personally, I wouldn't go out of my way to come to Joe's Shanghai because there are easily three times as many places back home that sell the same quality of xiao long bao.

I started with the pork soup dumplings, which were really good and had a rich, thick and slightly salty broth. I had trouble eating them as they were large but thank goodness I didn't get it on my white shirt. Next I got the shredded pork with dried bean curd and jalapeño. The dish was not spicy at all and was not great. I think it could have benefitted from some more sauce but I also don't like my food on the dry side - personal preference. They end off everybody's meal by brining orange slices before the check. I was stuffed and happy with my meal, and all I wanted was a cold beer to be on my way.

There isn't anything special about the interior, but the emphasis is placed on the quality of their food. Note: they only take cash![ Pork Soup Dumplings ] Our group of four ordered four sets of soup dumplings. Each set is served in a dim sum box and comes with 8 soup dumplings. The soup dumplings were bigger than I expected and they spill over the soup spoon. The skin of thick but easy to break apart and the flavor of the soup is deliciously rich. My friend taught me her technique! First, you bite a hole into the soup dumpling and drain the soup into the spoon. Then you dip the rest of the dumpling into the provided vinegar and chase it all down with the soup. [ Scallion Pancakes ] Very crispy and oily! These served as great ""sponges"" to soak up any soup that spilled from the soup dumplings.",124,920,2,1,2,4

However, I wasn't a fan of the presentation.  It came out with gravy spread all around, leaving very few crispy edges.  I like when places pour it on at your table and focus on creating only a tiny pile in the middle.Crispy Pork Chop with Pepper Salt: Kinda disappointing.  The pork chop bits were really tough.  Also, random bone and gristle made for unpleasant surprises when eating, since it's hard to see beneath the deep fried coating.  Worth passing by next time.",2222,341,2,0,0,4

They hyped it up as being the best Greek restaurant in the Bay Area, but I had to make that determination for myself. My boyfriend's birthday was coming up, so I made a reservation at Evvia Estiatorio via OpenTable. I made it a month in advance and quite frankly had no issues with booking the time and date I wanted. It wasn't until I read some of the reviews about Evvia Estiatorio on Yelp after the fact that it was one of those restaurants that had a super long wait to get into (e.g. 3 months in advance). I guess I lucked out!Our dinner reservation was for 6:15pm on a Wednesday. My boyfriend and I were both shocked by how packed the place already was. We were kindly greeted by an older gentleman in a suit, whom I presumed was the owner. Despite the busyness, there were two couples tables readily available. Our host gave us the option to decide which table we wanted, so we took the one located underneath an indoor awning that had a nice overall view of the restaurant. I sat back and took a moment to take in all the sights and sounds. It felt elegant but also casual because of the liveliness and loudness that the guests brought to the space. I liked the simplistic rustic design, open kitchen, and ambient lighting. The customer service was excellent. Our main waiter was friendly, personable, and attentive. The bussers were equally as attentive. They were on top of filling our waters and clearing plates, and they even kept each other in check. There was a point when our food came out, but we didn't get a fresh set of silverware yet. The server who carried our food out would not place the food on our table until we received our silverware. Talk about accountability! Furthermore, the owner did his share of rounds at each table, including ours, to ask if guests were enjoying themselves. My boyfriend and I are not the types to spend hours just hanging around the dinner table. We like to have our meals and then move on to the next thing. We got our appetizers in 5 minutes from ordering, and then received our entrees shortly after. We both appreciated how we finished our entire dinner experience - from getting seated to receiving the bill - in 30 minutes. I'm all about speed and efficiency as long as quality isn't compromised. I truly liked everything I ate at Evvia Estiatorio, and in general I thought that our food was made well and with good ingredients. I love spankopita. These little spinach and feta filled puff pastries are so delightful and my personal favorite Greek appetizers. I absolutely had to order spanakotiropita to share between me and my boyfriend. It came in an order of 2 but rather than serving ourselves, a waiter placed a spanakotiropita on each of our plate. We both agreed that it was the best we've had. The phyllo was flaky, and I loved the generous chunks of feta. The spinach and leeks filling made for a unique blend. Sidenote: I learned something new today. The word, ""spankopita,"" is like a shortened version of the word, ""spanakotiropita."" ""Tiropita"" describes the egg/cheese and can actually be its own standalone puff pastry by the same name. I'll have to try tiropitas next time I see it on a menu. For my entree I ordered moussaka, which is my favorite Greek dish. If you haven't had it before, it's like a Greek lasagna made with egg plant, potatoes, béchamel sauce, and ground lamb or beef (Evvia Estiatorio uses lamb). Admittedly I've had better moussaka elsewhere, but I thought Evvia Estiatorio's version of it was still good. I was definitely satisfied with it. My boyfriend had the Arnisia Paidakia dish consisting of rib-cut, mesquite-grilled lamb chops. I liked the roasted potatoes that complimented the dish. They were thick cuts and nicely crispy on the edges. The lamb chops were hands down the best prepared lamb I've had at a restaurant. The meat was a little bit on the medium well side though my boyfriend asked for medium rare. Nonetheless, the meat was tender, juicy, and flavorful.",431,795,8,5,3,4.5

Roasted pork was moist and seasoned well, I liked the extra crunchy skin that didn't not taste overwhelming oily. Mushrooms was the second best highlight of the night but buttermilk cake wasn't anything special. All in all, service is very attentive.

Now sure if it's because the place is now super busy, or because many of the amazing servers that used to work here have turned over. However, we've been coming here for 7 years and I can say unequivocally that it was better before. Today, we order two grilled fishes (dorade and branzino) and the lamb (typical for us overindulgent folk) and got great food. However, what has kept us coming back over the years was the formerly great service, which was severely lacking today. Unfortunately, as a young couple of color, I have to wonder whether this is discrimination. In a place which is 90% white and 70% over the age of 40, we were definitely a minority in many regards. The specifics: My water was empty for over an hour. After failing to get anyone's attention, even the guy who was watering tables around us, I drank all of my husband's water and our wine (maybe it was intentional??). Our server was nowhere to be found most of the night. Yet the older white people around me all managed to put in their orders just fine. We order a lot of food-- seriously, probably too much food. But all the tables around us got way better service. The chef came out to chat with many of the tables nearby. By not us, who are regulars. Finally, we were celebrating our anniversary. Usually, for a special occasion, they do the generous and hospitable thing which is give a dessert. Not this time. We got nothing more than a rush to pay the check.

It contained eggplant, lamb, cheese, and potatoes. If you're not too keen on gamey meat, this dish may not be for you as the lamb's flavor was robust. If you don't mind, this is a great filling and hearty dish. Per our server's suggestion, we ended up ordering the custard filled lumpia dish with pistachio ice cream.

We went on a Friday night and it's in downtown Palo Alto so we made reservations a day before (definitely recommend doing that, especially on weekends). We got seated right away, right next to where the fresh free bread gets sliced (comes with salt and olive oil). After looking at reviews and getting recommendations from our waitress, we ordered the rokasalata which was an arugula based salad topped with walnuts, apples, mini blocks of cheese, pomegranate seeds with balsamic vinegar. It was very refreshing and I loved the different crunches to the salad. We also ordered octopus and lamb riblets as appetizers. We considered getting lamb as our main course but we definitely recommend getting lamb as an appetizer because of how strong  of flavor and heavy the meat usually is, and getting a light fish dish as the main! The octopus was delicious, bite sized chewy pieces doused in olive oil and lemon. The lamb riblets were so tender and fell right off the bone. Dipping the bread in both the remnants of the octopus and lamb is a must! The sea bass was the star of the night! We went with the grilled option over oven baked because it came with Swiss chard when grilled which was delicious. What was amazing was that the fish was pulled apart off the bones before it came to our table so didn't have to waste any time picking out little fish bones. It was so flavorful, a good balance of the natural fish flavor and the spices it was cooked in, and wasn't dry at all which I've definitely experienced at other restaurants. Besides the bread, none of the actual dishes we ordered had carbs so we didn't feel sick and stuffed, and got to have tastes of seafood, meat and vegetables!

The lamb chops, which come with a side of roasted potatoes, are incredibly flavorful, and they melt in your mouth like butter. The branzino is fantastic as well, and might be my favorite fish dish I've eaten to this point.

There was about 11 of us and our waitress kept her poise the entire experience, I understand how challenging it can be with a huge party. We started off with several apps: watermelon salad (it was the special), meatballs, grilled artichoke and eggplant, the octopus (my personal favorite), zucchini balls and calamari. Some dishes we ordered multiple of either because we loved it or there wasn't enough for everyone to try it. The entrees were the main event! The special was the rotisserie pork on a bed of greens, others ordered a ribeye steak and lamb shanks. I ordered the grilled whole fish. It was tasty, but a little dry and be careful of all the bones. I had to order a side of orzo rice on the side to complete the meal (I love me some carbs)! The pork was my favorite dish by far!Desserts was the icing on the cake. We had the custard cannoli thingys served with pistachio ice cream, lave cake with sour cherry ice cream, and baklava with vanilla ice cream. My personal favorite was the custard and baklava! Of course, the ice cream is always a good side for any dessert.Honestly, the food is worth the dining experience. We were the biggest party in the restaurant and it was little tight.

Bottom line: Good to great food with attentive service in a nice atmosphere, but you're going to pay for it.Food: The lamb chops, octopus appetizer, and spanakopita were some of our favorites. Lamb chops were flavorful and tender, octopus was some of the most tender I've had, and spanakopita was very tasty. The braised lamb shank was ok but a little monotonous after a bit. I know the wood grilled branzino gets great reviews but it was a little on the drier and underseasoned side for our tastes and we also found a bone or two which isn't great when you have young kids.Service: Attentive and friendly. GreatAmbiance: Classy yet still comfortable. Lively and bustling but yet cozy and not too loudValue: Evvia is pricey. That being said, you get what you pay for at the end of the day.

For mains we got the branzino which they offered to debone for us and the lamb chops - the two most famous dishes in the restaurant. The branzino had great quality fish and a bit of a char but there just wasn't as much flavor as there should have been. It was a little underseasoned. The portion was pretty well sized but more that some small bones still remained (not unexpected though). The lamb chops were fairly well cooked but the meat was a little more grainy than I'd have liked. The cooking developed good flavor but the chops themselves were inconsistent - a couple were far too lean and lacked the juciness of a good lamb chops and another had large amounts of fat. I'd expect for the price point to have better quality cuts of meat. We skipped dessert.

Priced fairly for a rib eye ($56).Wine selections: Pinot Noir here is a little on the sweeter side, but very delicious.",743,765,3,0,0,4.5

We had a group of 6 and from the moment we sat down our server was unfriendly, cold and she simply didn't care to serve us. We didn't know what was wrong as we were not a demanding or loud group. We sat quietly and from the moment we arrived we were decisive about what appetizers we wanted to start with. We didn't order a ton of food and none of us had any special requests. It was very straightforward. Yet The server did not bother to greet us, did not smile and didn't want to talk to us. We had to flag her down for water and a glass of wine. When we asked for recommendations she had none to offer. We ordered appetizers and the individual who placed them on the table didn't say what he was putting in front of us. The servers just slapped the food on the table and walked away. Some appetizers looked similar to others and we weren't sure what we ordered. Then we realized our server had forgotten an appetizer and we were afraid to mention it for fear she would become even more unfriendly. So we held off in mentioning it. Finally the appetizer arrived over 20 minutes later and she had nothing to say.All of this was very odd as this isn't the typical Evvia experience and we were very confused. When we looked around everyone was running around chaotically. It was busy yes but overly busy to the point where the atmosphere was extremely loud and we were yelling over each other.We finally ordered entrees and again they were slapped on the table as if servers didnt care. Very abrupt. And no one can be bothered for questions. Need more bread? Don't ask. Need more water? Don't askUltimately this was not the place to eat to celebrate the holidays and sadly I won't be coming back. My friends and I feel embarrassed about coming here and wish we dined somewhere more friendly. It's simply too busy for any service and I guess a group of 6 is not ideal for this restaurant.

I made a reservation a week ago, and the earliest opening they had was at 7:45pm, so I showed up hungry and ready to eat my heart out. We ordered:Spanakotiropita - two triangles of paper-thin phyllo wrapped around spinach and cheese. A bit reminiscent of spinach artichoke dip. I'm still impressed by how thin the phyllo was. If only phyllo chips existed. Marithes tiganites - crispy smelts. Considering we had just paid $10 for two fried triangles, we were pleasantly surprised by the small mountain of fried fish we got. The dip looked like garlic but was actually a zesty combination of potato and lemon. Psari psito - wow, a whole fish! It was so tender and fresh. Kokinisto me manestra - lamb shank. The meat fell off the bone and at the touch of my fork. The orzo was buttery and delicious. It was a pretty heavy dish, and I needed my boyfriend's help to eat half of it. Yiaourti - Greek yogurt for dessert. This has ruined all yogurt for me. It was so thick and creamy, topped with soft, sweet dates and drizzled with honey. Good thing my boyfriend was so toasted after the lamb plate that he let me have most of this!It was kind of difficult flagging down our waiter in the beginning, but they were very generous with the bread refills (we may have gone through a whole loaf).",362,686,2,2,0,4.5

The super attentive service, the open kitchen, and the choreography of it all brings together a great setting for delicious food! Make a reservation early--this place is popular for good reason.Evvia's menu consists of a long list of mezedhes (appetizers) and larger entrees. Their entrees are all done simply and are delicious, but I was so much more impressed with their creative small plates, which are perfect for sharing. The soutzoukakia (grilled lamb meatballs) with tomato sauce were so tender and meaty; the taramosalata (fish roe dip) and tzatziki (cucumber/yogurt sauce) with pita were both so creamy and delicious as well. We also had the gigantes (giant baked beans in tomato sauce with feta), the crispy, salty saghanaki cheese, the flavorful and fatty grilled lamb riblets, and best of all, the sliced grilled octopus, which was amazingly tender and popped with fresh flavors.For our entrees, we ordered the grilled pork chop with beans, sausage, tomato, and bell pepper, but the pork chop was slightly overcooked. Far superior was a special they had--a whole roast lamb that was sliced up and seasoned boldly with oregano and olive oil. My goodness--the lamb was fall-apart tender yet bold and gamey at the same time! The dish even came with a piece of crispy lamb skin, along with crispy potato wedges and lemon! Amazing!Finally, we had to close with dessert. There's one thing in particular that's definitely worth getting, and that's the galaktoboureko, a semolina custard wrapped in thin, crispy filo dough and served with homemade pistachio ice cream. Where to start? The semolina custard had the perfect amount of creaminess and sweetness, which contrasted nicely with the crispness of the filo and the crunch of the pistachio chunks in the ice cream! Simply amazing!Yes, this is the place to come if fine dining is on order! The menu prices are relatively high, but certainly worth the quality of fresh ingredients and bold flavors you'll find in every carefully prepared dish!",1145,5763,1,2,0,4.5

We arrived around 11am and the place was already full.....not out-the-door-packed with-a-long-wait full....thank goodness! ...managed to get a pretty nice booth right away.Being a fan of breakfasts, we already had a good idea what we wanted order.....it also helped that they have German pancakes here, which was one of the big reasons why we chose to come dine here. We went ahead and ordered the German Pancake, and an egg white West Coast Omelette ....with sides of hash browns and two pancakes (instead of toast), coffee and tea.Wow....the first thing we notice when the food arrived was they're very big portions.....well worth the price, and second, how perfectly cooked and absolutely yummeeee everything looked! I place great emphasis on a breakfast by how good their hash browns are, and the hash browns here are very good.....not the thin grated potato strands like traditional breakfasts places, but more fettuccine sized strips, perfectly cooked with a lovely soft and fluffy inside and golden brown crisp on top. The omelette was very delicious too....full of ingredients and perfectly fluffy. My girlfriend was first to try the pancakes, and judging from her ""When Harry Met Sally"" at the diner scene look, I knew she had just tasted one of the best pancakes in town. I then took a bite and would have to agree, they were good! Thick, fluffy, and hot off the griddle .....perfect with the warmed syrup that came served with it. Warmed syrup.....love the thought and detail they put into making the pancake experience just perfect. As for the German Pancake.....so soft, moist, and equally as yummy with the warmed syrup, and a dash of fresh squeezed lemon for that yummily perfect pop in the mouth!Everything was so good that we finished every morsel of our yummy breakfast.....even when we couldn't eat anymore, we made the extra effort to finish the last bits of everything....yes, that good.

If you don't get what I'm saying, the portions are massive.What I really love about the restaurant is their ability to flip tables. At any given time, it looks like there is a swarm of people outside (which there is), but getting a table for four even when it's the most crowded during the weekend never seems to be more than 20-minutes. They're efficient.For food, I like their omelettes, specifically the ham and cheese and they'll give you a mountain of potatoes and toast to go with it. If you're really hungry, you can go the biscuits and gravy route instead or sub for a pancake. I do like their pancakes, but if you order as a stack, it's more like a heap and they'll pile the toppings on high. Be still my fatty heart.As with most diners, the menu is overly extensive.

The country skillet is described as fried steak pieces and eggs atop biscuits and gravy and potatoes with pancakes on the side. The service was excellent. The restaurant was nicely decorated, clean and well run. The restaurant temperature was way too cold, but the other patrons didn't seem to mind. I imagine that it will heat up when it starts getting busier.The cut up fried steak was just ok. It tasted of well used fryer oil. I would not order it again. The eggs were exactly as I ordered them. The biscuits were under the potatoes and gravy so it was hard to distinguish the two. The biscuits were not the flaky kind but the spongy kind. The gravy was disappointing for a restaurant that specializes in breakfast. There was no detectable animal fat flavor, butter flavor or dairy flavor. The texture was as if it was thickened with starch. The flavors I noticed were salt and pepper. I know it must be hard to do scratch country gravy consistently every day.

We had the Belgian strawberry waffle and the banana nut waffle, and it was delish! Crisp exterior and fluffy interior. Definitely a winner. I could honestly eat that banana nut waffle all day with the fresh whipped cream that came on top. The Crab Cake Benedict was so good as well! I think someone may have  accidentally heated the hollandaise sauce improperly as it wasn't emulsified with the butter but nonetheless the crab cakes stayed crisp and were so well complimented with the flavor of the sauce. No regrets!Denver Potato Cakes: Pretty good with the apple sauce. Not our favorite thing on the menu but we didn't regret trying it.Thanks for the great experience and the yummy food. We'll be back to try many more items on that menu. Meh who am I kidding? We'll probably get the same winners next time around too. hah!",300,73,1,0,1,4

You should definitely come with a group of friends and go family style or be prepared to go home with a lot of leftovers (I only managed to eat a 1/3 of my croque madam) but my guy friends managed to finish 3/4 to all of their plates!

After the walk, they get brunch and tell me all about it. Hello? Where is the invite? One day, I decided to join my friends afterwards around 9 am. The minute I got there, there was already a line. They opened at 9 am and already a line. That already said a lot about the place. My friends and I got two orders of hot fried chicken and shared it. OH MY LORD! I literally found myself greedily grabbing more chicken before I finished the one on my plate. The dish comes with two large juicy chicken pieces perfectly fried after it has been brined in pickle juice and buttermilk. Then, it is doused with a hot sauce elixir that makes the already delicious chicken fabulous! Just when you think things can't get better, they top the chicken with a mound of thinly sliced pickles and serve creamy grits and biscuits on the side. Do yourself a favor and forget about the biscuit/ grits. Yes, they are good, but the chicken is the star and, Jesus Christmas, it is the best fried chicken I ever had. Actually, let's bring the grits/ biscuit back because the hot sauce needs something to sop it up. The thing I like about this dish is that the pickles cut into the greasey/ oily fried chicken so you don't feel so heavy afterwards. It gives you an illusion of lightness, but don't be fooled, it is not. I had this last Sunday and I am already craving it already. My friend took the leftover bits home and I thought she was silly because there wasn't much left, but.... I was a fool. I should have fought her for the bit. So I am on a plane on my way to New Orleans and as I was boarding the plane, I was telling my friend how I wished I had the chicken before we left the city and the lady in front of us was like ""Jacob's Pickle? I love that place!"" We instantly became friends. When you know, you know. BUT! One thing, I got a side of pickled eggs because I thought about my friend's mom who makes bomb pickled eggs. Don't get it. It is a bit off... Hot chicken dish! You will think of me and scatter rose petals wherever I walk for giving you the best advice of all time. For the first time in forever I was excited about a dish. Being a foodie obsessed with how things are made and just having a very particular preference, it is really hard to get me excited about certain things, but this one. Wow! ALSO! After this, we got Levain bakery cookies so.... our day really couldn't go wrong even if we got hit by the car.",37,163,1,2,2,4

I'll certainly give em a go on the next trip.I enjoyed the bacon, egg & cheese biscuit. As you can see by the pic, it's the size of the plate! It's locally sourced, I appreciate that.

Now the hot chicken biscuit sandwich, the chicken was seasoned and fried well but the sauce this dish uses was very oily and it made the biscuit underneath too greasy to eat. The cheddar grits it came with was awfully gelatinous. I would try a different chicken sandwich next time and hopefully this was just a bad batch of grits.

The waiter was really nice in explaining what specials they had, the popular items they have on the menu, and warming us that the portion sizes are pretty big. I'm glad he did because the 3 dishes that we had got were enough for the 4 of us to feel stuffed but happy when we left the restaurant.We ordered the French toast, Croque Madame, and the Sausage Gravy Chicken Biscuit. Each of these dishes had a unique flavor profile to itself, despite having a biscuit in every dish. I've never had a French Toast biscuit before but this was a game changer. The dish already had 4 different pieces of French toast. The outside was nice and crunch with a light sugar powdering, topped with a nice serving of strawberries. Their syrup they have on the table also wasn't too sweet so I didn't feel like it over powered the other flavors. The Croque Madame was huge! The stacked fried egg over the ham, friend buttermilk chicken, over a biscuit with amazing sauce was super delicious. It was a little bit salty, but the flavors really matched. The biscuit they utilized in this dish also had bacon bits cooked within it. This dish also comes with circular cut potatoes, some are thin so it's crunch like a chip but some of the other ones still had the fluffy potato texture.The last dish, the sausage gravy chicken biscuit, is definitely a super comfort food. The gravy itself was rich in flavor and paired well with the spices in the buttermilk chicken. I'm typically not a fan of grits but the way they mixed the cheese into the grits made it really delicious. I would definitely come back here to try their pickles and beer. They have a really amazing selection on the menu that I'm dying to try.",330,43,0,0,0,4

It's close to my boyfriend's new apartment and we were hungry so we took the gamble. We came on a Saturday night, right around peak dinner time. Surprisingly, we were seated right away. First and foremost, the food is b.o.m.b [makes bomb sound effects]. I had the Honey Chicken Biscuit [$17] which comes with cheese grits. The farms they source their chickens from must have a workout regime. The piece of buttermilk fried chicken was the biggest I've seen in my life. While it was huge, it was also cooked expertly. It was incredibly juicy on the inside and fried to crispy perfection on the outside. The biscuit it came on, oh boy, that was a flakey, buttery biscuit. Lest I forget, the cheese grits tasted like Thanksgiving mashed potatoes minus the tryptophan-induced coma. This dish is literally all I can think about a few weeks later. My boyfriend had the Chicken & Pancakes [$19]. He said he likes a version of this dish better at The Common in Brooklyn. Idk...his opinion doesn't count [I'm the worst]. I also had a cider, Graft Salt & Sand [$9], which is fruity and acidic. It's nice to drink something refreshing while eating something rich and heavy. He had the root beer, which he enjoyed. I do not like root beer. ___Unfortunately, the air conditioner was not working. It was humid outside and not much better inside, even with the fans blowing. The cooling system dripped on our table as well as the table next to ours. It didn't seem like anyone cared all too much. In any event, we got a free shower. Lucky that my boyfriend and I have been together for awhile. The restaurant is loud and we wouldn't be able to hear each other even if we wanted to. Service wasn't the most attentive as it was busy. This is definitely not somewhere you want to go on a first date, unless you do not plan on a second one.

A great fruity taste! And to complete the meal we had skillet cookie with ice creams. Since we like pickles anyways we loved the pickle choices and their each individual flavors. Our hands down favorite were the special sours. No complaints there!The pasta was good with plenty of cheese, but impossible to be eaten in one sitting (unless you really don't care about your cholesterol sky rocketing). The patty was served on toasted flattened buns, which we liked a lot. Their French fries are great too! Our least favorite dish would have to be cookie.

My friend and I went on a Friday night so they were packed but the hostess was very accommodating and texted within 20-25 minutes when a table was ready. The last time I went here I solely ordered the appetizers so I decided to finally try the southern biscuit sandwiches the second time around. We got the fried pickles to start and it was as good as I had remembered it being before. Do take note that the pickles are sliced in the ""long way"" and are thick versus thin circular pieces (pardon my lack of eloquence). In regards to the biscuits, my friend got the hot chicken biscuit and I got the Southern BLT. The portions. Dear god. Trust me when I say that I can eat but even I couldn't finish the whole biscuit. The plate is massive and the sandwich was, quite literally, the size of my face. And yes, portion size is not the only great part about it as it definitely fulfilled that comfort food craving that we have from time to time (or maybe that's just me). If I had to pick between the two, I would definitely go for the hot chicken biscuit instead of the Southern BLT. Not that the Southern BLT is bad, but it just had a little too much going on and lacked flavor (which is why I knocked off a star). The hot chicken, however, was simple (in the sense that it was ""just"" chicken, hot sauce, and pickles) and had a LOT more flavor. If I were to ever go back to Jacob's Pickles, I would definitely order this instead. Take note that all of the sandwiches are served with organic cheese grits, which, combined with a bite of the sandwich, might give you high cholesterol ins but it would totally be worth it :).

The waitstaff has always been super cool. That being said tonight's experience has left me never wanting to return. I came in and put my name down for a table of 3. We were told it would be about a 30min wait but we were willing to chill at the bar so nbd. We eventually get our table after a few awkward mix ups with the host (it was super loud and crowded and it was to be expected). Once sat our party ordered 2 appetizers (fried pickles and poutine, both go tos) 3 meals and 3 rounds of drinks. As we were finishing our last round of drinks the manager comes over and word for word says, ""so you guys are going to leave soon right?"" To which we respond, ""yep, just finishing up, we'll be out of here soon"" ""No but like soon, soon"" in a very curt manner. As if we were not a table of customers who had just ordered $300 worth of food from this establishment. 2 out of three of us work in restaurants and decided that though she handled the situation in the most unprofessional and disrespectful way possible we would finish our drinks, go to the restroom, and head out. While we took turns using the restroom (because we all wanted to finished our drinks as well) this manager made a point of casting is mean looks at us and came over to the table 2 additional times to say that there was a reservation for that table and we needed to leave. Something that would have been fine if we were notified at our seating about a time limit as is customary in most ny restaurants. It literally took one of our party to call her out on her lack of professionalism for her to finally offer us another table if we'd be willing to move (how this entire conversation should have started). As she said this our last person returned from the restroom and we left because there was no way we would be giving this restaurant anymore more money for they way we were treated. If you have a set reservation and want to fill a table before that, I get it. But let your guests know first. That way they can plan their meal around it.

My first mistake is not coming in sooner. A couple weeks ago I finally decided to try Jacob's Pickles on a Friday evening. Our wait time was minimal & when we were seated, it was at one of the communal picnic benches in the back room. This restaurant is more spacious than the crowded front bar area lead me to believe. We each ordered a Southern biscuit fried chicken sandwich & soon saw how foolish we had been; the portions are such that three of us could have shared one (not that anyone's counting but this is mistake #2.) $17 each for my Honey Chicken & Pickles and the Hot Chicken Biscuit (you want this Nashville hot sauce!) & $18 for the Southern BLT which stars the incredible fried green tomato. All accompanied by an addictive side of salty, buttery grits. Not ordering some variety of their namesake food (cukes, beets, carrots, jalapeños, even eggs, etc.), thinking the pickles on our sandwiches would suffice -- well, that was my third mistake. As tables received their orders of colorful pickled veggies, I resigned myself to my meal devoid of any pickley assortment. My being a flawed individual benefits you.

The chicken was rather soggy with the breading falling off and also looked white rather than crispy fried chicken. Seems like the chicken was undercooked. Pancakes were very doughy.. felt like they needed to be left a little longer on the griddle. My boyfriends food was even worse. He got the nashville chicken biscuit. The biscuit was soaked in grease and it was not a biscuit anymore when he went to pick it up. It was a soggy soaked grease piece of biscuit. Horrible food. Waited over an hour to eat junk.

The entrees at Jacob's Pickles were great and I would still highly recommend the place. I had the sausage gravy smothered fried chicken and it was phenomenal. The grits that came as the side were pretty plain and nothing to rave about. My girlfriend had the cheeseburger mac which was also very good (and literally a full cast iron skillet's-worth)Can confirm the portions are massive! Working backwards though, things start going downhill. We tried the deviled eggs and the fried pickles for apps, and they weren't very good. The pickles were way to thinly sliced and all you could taste was the breading. The deviled eggs had a huge amount of yolk (both on top and a bed of it underneath) that was just too much, and it had a gritty texture. When we arrived we were told there would be a 35 minute wait, and recieved a text message after waiting about that long. However, when you are texted and go to the hosts, they have you wait off to the side until your table is actually ready. This is a tiny, cramped area where you are constantly dodging waiters/waitresses while trying not to crowd the people seated around you. We waited for about 10 minutes with two other groups, and were told we could be seated at a table of 6 with 2 other parties, or would need to wait another 15. We chose to wait, but at this point have been waiting for over an hour total and are stuck in this terrible spot, becoming frustrated. Why can't people wait outside after they have been texted? We waited an hour and 15 minutes in total to be seated, compared to the 35 minutes we were originally told. I know it's tough to estimate these things, but ths 35 minutes wasn't for our own table and never should have been told to us without noting that. Waiting in the cramped space for about a half hour was also a terrible experience and certainly doesnt help the wait staff Luckily it was worth it for the amazing entree, but my girlfriend and I were frustrated and impatient by the time we were seated.

I've been coming to Joe's since they first opened at Pell Street as a child with my family. Tonight we were surprised at the upgraded restaurant and decor, a big change from the dingy restaurant we've been going to for 20+ years. Everything is new and cleaner looking and the high ceilings and decorative wood decor make this place much more comfortable. Gone are the majority of the large tables which often had   four or more different parties crammed in, replaced by more sensible square tables of 2 or 4 for a more private dining experience. Gone are also the opportunities to chat with tourists and reach across the table to share a bite or two of each other's dish.Is it better? Hard to say. It's definitely more comfortable and LOOKS cleaner. The soup dumplings, the ones we've been eating for 20+ years and what defined my idea of a soup dumpling growing up, has changed somewhat. The skin is thicker (though I have argued it has been thicker for a few years now), the broth thinner with less lip sticking collagen and fat, and the overall soup dumpling (all 4 of the orders we placed) was lukewarm at best, not the same tongue scalding hot as they were at Pell Street. Not sure if this was an opening night fluke or if this will be permanent. Prices are the same as the Pell Street location as it should be since Joe's recently went through significant price hikes a few years ago bringing a regular soup dumpling from $4.95 to $7.95.Scallion pancake also had doubled in price but not quantity or quality and while the fried rice remains the same price, it looks like they changed to smaller serving plates. The szechuan beef noodle soup, never actually spicy, has been put into a larger bowl now. I asked for them to make it extra spicy to get a hint of spice but even that came with a touch of off-putting sweetness. Veggies, particularly snow pea leaves, are deep fried and extremely overpriced for the portion. Recommend everyone stay far away from the vegetables section and eat those elsewhere. Overall the new location looks nice but was not impressed with tonight's soup dumplings or most of the other food. Hope it is just a fluke as they are getting used to the new space and kitchens.P. S.

They're not stingy with the crab either but be careful when eating this because there might be some shell still in the meat mixture. I crunched on a few. The dumplings of course come with the vinegar soy sauce and ginger as well as chili sauce which had a sour taste to me. We also ordered the pan fried noodles.

We enjoyed our experience so we returned on a saturday late afternoon only to realize there was a huge line waiting. We ordered to-go and had a picnic at the park nearby.

Saturday afternoon, was able to get a seat at a large communal table without any wait. Most of the main dishes are on the expensive side as they are family-style. Since I didn't have a family with me, I opted instead for the Spring Roll ($2.75) and the Pork Soup Dumplings ($8). While waiting, you are served green tea that's piping hot and good for the stomach. Spring roll is served with a side of soy sauce and stuffed with shrimp and pork. Found it to be overly greasy and not well balanced. The flavor of the shrimp was the saving grace. Soup dumplings come shortly after, several steamed pieces served with soy sauce and ginger. Again, flavor is a little dull - could have used some more spices for the added kick. Towards the last few the dumplings got much colder, so didn't finish the last two.Servers come around often to make sure they get people in and out quickly. Not a fan of the automatic gratuity to go along with cash-only policies (especially since the main courses are more expensive).",314,1748,3,1,0,4

But those were probably my favorite items I tried.When we got our check, we got orange slices- the healthiest thing I ate all day.I was glad I got to try it for the experience, I will def have to check out the one in Flushing now, but, I can't go with another group that big, I almost got stuck at the table.  Oh yea, and if you are a germophobe- steer clear of this place, just saying...",1713,1437,5,6,4,4

The pork soup dumplings (8 pieces) are huge! And there's so much fatty, savory soup inside. If this is your first time eating soup dumplings, DO NOT just take a bite out of the dumpling. The soup inside the dumplings is meant to be drained/drank first. I felt that the skin was a little too thick.

But even I have to admit there's only so much pizza a guy can eat before he gets tired of it.Came here around 4 pm on a Saturday afternoon. There was a HUGE crowd of people outside, and I wasn't about to wait longer than 15 minutes to sit down. Thankfully, since I was by myself, I didn't have to wait. Sat down immediately at a shared table, I guess that's just how they do it here with the lack of significant dining space.I only got one thing, the pork meat soup dumplings or xiao long bao. They don't look pretty at all, but they are solid and on par with some of the places back home. They definitely bring the soup in soup dumplings. Trying to eat one of these bad boys in one bite was not a good idea between how big each dumpling was and how hot the soup inside each dumpling was. Pork was fairly run-of-the-mill, nothing overly memorable. Overall, not bad.Service was actually pretty decent for a Chinese place. They're very VERY motivated on one thing, getting you in and out as soon as possible so that they can sit the next party. Joe's is very well-staffed though, so getting someone's attention is not very difficult. And they all speak English, given how many non-Asians pass through here. So yeah, the service is better than your average Chinese place.Personally, I wouldn't go out of my way to come to Joe's Shanghai because there are easily three times as many places back home that sell the same quality of xiao long bao.

We ordered a bunch of dishes and shared. We all agreed that the soup dumplings was the highlight! We still talk about the dumplings til this day LOL I wish we got another order. Some other dishes I enjoyed were the Shanghai noodles, scallion beef and general tso shrimp. My coworkers liked the scallion pancake but I thought it was too thick. Overall I would return for the noodles and dumplings. Be sure to come early because when we left, the crowd outside got bigger!",265,176,1,1,1,4

When you are seated, you essentially share a large table with multiple parties, which can be fun or awkward depending on the group dynamics and your personality. It was ok for us.The food failed to meet the expectations of the wait. We got the sesame noodles and the pork soup dumplings (xiao long bao). The sesame noodles were prepared poorly because of the flavor and the starchiness texture that accentuates the poor flavor. The xiao long bao was okay, as I have tried much better before. You carefully pick up the dumpling and place it in a spoon in case the soup leaks out. This was necessary because these dumplings are relatively large compared to the standard. The soup is pretty good but the pork inside needs improvement as it is not that flavorful. Overall, this place seems to be overhyped and definitely not worth the wait.",348,457,1,0,0,4

And at its price in a place like New York (8 soup dumplings for ~$8-9), it really can't get better than this. The scallion pancakes are another favorite dish of mine, partially because of the delicious sweet sauce that they use with it too! They're also really affordable, at around $5 for a stacked plate.

Joe's also includes a 15% tip when they give you the check at the end.

They hyped it up as being the best Greek restaurant in the Bay Area, but I had to make that determination for myself. My boyfriend's birthday was coming up, so I made a reservation at Evvia Estiatorio via OpenTable. I made it a month in advance and quite frankly had no issues with booking the time and date I wanted. It wasn't until I read some of the reviews about Evvia Estiatorio on Yelp after the fact that it was one of those restaurants that had a super long wait to get into (e.g. 3 months in advance). I guess I lucked out!Our dinner reservation was for 6:15pm on a Wednesday. My boyfriend and I were both shocked by how packed the place already was. We were kindly greeted by an older gentleman in a suit, whom I presumed was the owner. Despite the busyness, there were two couples tables readily available. Our host gave us the option to decide which table we wanted, so we took the one located underneath an indoor awning that had a nice overall view of the restaurant. I sat back and took a moment to take in all the sights and sounds. It felt elegant but also casual because of the liveliness and loudness that the guests brought to the space. I liked the simplistic rustic design, open kitchen, and ambient lighting. The customer service was excellent. Our main waiter was friendly, personable, and attentive. The bussers were equally as attentive. They were on top of filling our waters and clearing plates, and they even kept each other in check. There was a point when our food came out, but we didn't get a fresh set of silverware yet. The server who carried our food out would not place the food on our table until we received our silverware. Talk about accountability! Furthermore, the owner did his share of rounds at each table, including ours, to ask if guests were enjoying themselves. My boyfriend and I are not the types to spend hours just hanging around the dinner table. We like to have our meals and then move on to the next thing. We got our appetizers in 5 minutes from ordering, and then received our entrees shortly after. We both appreciated how we finished our entire dinner experience - from getting seated to receiving the bill - in 30 minutes. I'm all about speed and efficiency as long as quality isn't compromised. I truly liked everything I ate at Evvia Estiatorio, and in general I thought that our food was made well and with good ingredients. I love spankopita. These little spinach and feta filled puff pastries are so delightful and my personal favorite Greek appetizers. I absolutely had to order spanakotiropita to share between me and my boyfriend. It came in an order of 2 but rather than serving ourselves, a waiter placed a spanakotiropita on each of our plate. We both agreed that it was the best we've had. The phyllo was flaky, and I loved the generous chunks of feta. The spinach and leeks filling made for a unique blend. Sidenote: I learned something new today. The word, ""spankopita,"" is like a shortened version of the word, ""spanakotiropita."" ""Tiropita"" describes the egg/cheese and can actually be its own standalone puff pastry by the same name. I'll have to try tiropitas next time I see it on a menu. For my entree I ordered moussaka, which is my favorite Greek dish. If you haven't had it before, it's like a Greek lasagna made with egg plant, potatoes, béchamel sauce, and ground lamb or beef (Evvia Estiatorio uses lamb). Admittedly I've had better moussaka elsewhere, but I thought Evvia Estiatorio's version of it was still good. I was definitely satisfied with it. My boyfriend had the Arnisia Paidakia dish consisting of rib-cut, mesquite-grilled lamb chops. I liked the roasted potatoes that complimented the dish. They were thick cuts and nicely crispy on the edges. The lamb chops were hands down the best prepared lamb I've had at a restaurant.

Word of advice: call to make reservations as opposed to using Open Table or anything of that sort because it may not be so accurate.Upon checking in we were seated within ten minutes or so. Talk about prompt service right?? Our order for the night involved:-Wine, Aperol Spritz, & Midori Sour-[complimentary] Bread-Lamb Riblets-Crispy Calamari-Grilled Octopus-Tzatziki Plate-Mesquite Grilled Aged Ribeye-Mesquite Grilled Lamb Chops-Roasted Pork [special of the day]-Mushroom & Cheese Medley-Strawberry Buttermilk Cake-Greek Iced Coffee [stone ground, heated over hot sand]First and foremost, Evvia's Bread was absolutely delicious. The crusty outter shell & chewy interior is amazing!! Lamb riblets fell right off the bone and the game-y aspect was very minimal. Crispy calamari was great and complimented well with the  lemon garlic aioli & spicy pepper aioli. Grilled octopus was a miss imo- the super soft texture was not expected and the taste came off very bland. Tzatziki plate was delicious and smearing it on our steak worked out really well ontop of the veggies provided. Ribeye was good but the lamb chops were absolutely the BEST part of the entire meal! Roasted pork was moist and seasoned well, I liked the extra crunchy skin that didn't not taste overwhelming oily. Mushrooms was the second best highlight of the night but buttermilk cake wasn't anything special. All in all, service is very attentive. The food was definitely expensive but I can't honestly say everything reflected well with its pricing. Some things were enjoyed more and others could have been omitted completely. Do be advised that celebratory desserts are not complimentary, Evvia only provides ""complimentary candles"".

Now sure if it's because the place is now super busy, or because many of the amazing servers that used to work here have turned over. However, we've been coming here for 7 years and I can say unequivocally that it was better before. Today, we order two grilled fishes (dorade and branzino) and the lamb (typical for us overindulgent folk) and got great food. However, what has kept us coming back over the years was the formerly great service, which was severely lacking today. Unfortunately, as a young couple of color, I have to wonder whether this is discrimination. In a place which is 90% white and 70% over the age of 40, we were definitely a minority in many regards. The specifics: My water was empty for over an hour. After failing to get anyone's attention, even the guy who was watering tables around us, I drank all of my husband's water and our wine (maybe it was intentional??). Our server was nowhere to be found most of the night. Yet the older white people around me all managed to put in their orders just fine. We order a lot of food-- seriously, probably too much food. But all the tables around us got way better service. The chef came out to chat with many of the tables nearby. By not us, who are regulars. Finally, we were celebrating our anniversary. Usually, for a special occasion, they do the generous and hospitable thing which is give a dessert. Not this time. We got nothing more than a rush to pay the check. Honestly, would not go back despite the great food because I'm not sure why we're being treated this way. Leaves you with a bad feeling",137,190,6,2,2,4.5

I ended up ordering the Moussaka because I was a huge fan of it years ago at Kokkari in SF. The best way to describe the taste is a Mediterranean Shepard's pie. It contained eggplant, lamb, cheese, and potatoes. If you're not too keen on gamey meat, this dish may not be for you as the lamb's flavor was robust. If you don't mind, this is a great filling and hearty dish. Per our server's suggestion, we ended up ordering the custard filled lumpia dish with pistachio ice cream. I am totally blanking on the name but the dish was okay. Not my favorite dessert since I am not a huge fan of nut-flavored dishes such as almond and pistachio but it was an interesting dish to try.

We went on a Friday night and it's in downtown Palo Alto so we made reservations a day before (definitely recommend doing that, especially on weekends). We got seated right away, right next to where the fresh free bread gets sliced (comes with salt and olive oil). After looking at reviews and getting recommendations from our waitress, we ordered the rokasalata which was an arugula based salad topped with walnuts, apples, mini blocks of cheese, pomegranate seeds with balsamic vinegar. It was very refreshing and I loved the different crunches to the salad. We also ordered octopus and lamb riblets as appetizers. We considered getting lamb as our main course but we definitely recommend getting lamb as an appetizer because of how strong  of flavor and heavy the meat usually is, and getting a light fish dish as the main! The octopus was delicious, bite sized chewy pieces doused in olive oil and lemon. The lamb riblets were so tender and fell right off the bone. Dipping the bread in both the remnants of the octopus and lamb is a must! The sea bass was the star of the night! We went with the grilled option over oven baked because it came with Swiss chard when grilled which was delicious. What was amazing was that the fish was pulled apart off the bones before it came to our table so didn't have to waste any time picking out little fish bones. It was so flavorful, a good balance of the natural fish flavor and the spices it was cooked in, and wasn't dry at all which I've definitely experienced at other restaurants. Besides the bread, none of the actual dishes we ordered had carbs so we didn't feel sick and stuffed, and got to have tastes of seafood, meat and vegetables! The ambiance is romantic but not to the point where lights are so dimmed and you can't see what you're eating.

Personally, I've always, always been a HUGE fan of their sister-restaurant Kokkari in the city, and been wanting to check this spot out forever. I've honestly never gone to Kokkari for a lunch on my own dime (it was previously company lunches), so I never realized how pricey it can get around here for a salad and hummus side?! Tbh the bud was treating me for my bday, but I caught a glance of the final bill, and shockingly it was over $150. For LUNCH. I wanna say I love Evvia as much as I love Kokkari, and the menu did look almost exactly the same. But the bud and I each got a side salad as our main and asked for added protein, which the waitstaff happily obliged to. The only kicker was that my added salmon was $30+ on top of the nearly $15 mini salad. I meannn that's pretty ridiculous, amirite?!So, again, was the food good? Yes. Was the space nice? Yes.

The lamb chops, which come with a side of roasted potatoes, are incredibly flavorful, and they melt in your mouth like butter.

We started off with several apps: watermelon salad (it was the special), meatballs, grilled artichoke and eggplant, the octopus (my personal favorite), zucchini balls and calamari. Some dishes we ordered multiple of either because we loved it or there wasn't enough for everyone to try it. The entrees were the main event! The special was the rotisserie pork on a bed of greens, others ordered a ribeye steak and lamb shanks. I ordered the grilled whole fish. It was tasty, but a little dry and be careful of all the bones. I had to order a side of orzo rice on the side to complete the meal (I love me some carbs)! The pork was my favorite dish by far!Desserts was the icing on the cake. We had the custard cannoli thingys served with pistachio ice cream, lave cake with sour cherry ice cream, and baklava with vanilla ice cream. My personal favorite was the custard and baklava!

The branzino had great quality fish and a bit of a char but there just wasn't as much flavor as there should have been. It was a little underseasoned. The portion was pretty well sized but more that some small bones still remained (not unexpected though). The lamb chops were fairly well cooked but the meat was a little more grainy than I'd have liked. The cooking developed good flavor but the chops themselves were inconsistent - a couple were far too lean and lacked the juciness of a good lamb chops and another had large amounts of fat.

We had a group of 6 and from the moment we sat down our server was unfriendly, cold and she simply didn't care to serve us. We didn't know what was wrong as we were not a demanding or loud group. We sat quietly and from the moment we arrived we were decisive about what appetizers we wanted to start with. We didn't order a ton of food and none of us had any special requests. It was very straightforward. Yet The server did not bother to greet us, did not smile and didn't want to talk to us. We had to flag her down for water and a glass of wine. When we asked for recommendations she had none to offer. We ordered appetizers and the individual who placed them on the table didn't say what he was putting in front of us. The servers just slapped the food on the table and walked away. Some appetizers looked similar to others and we weren't sure what we ordered. Then we realized our server had forgotten an appetizer and we were afraid to mention it for fear she would become even more unfriendly. So we held off in mentioning it. Finally the appetizer arrived over 20 minutes later and she had nothing to say.All of this was very odd as this isn't the typical Evvia experience and we were very confused. When we looked around everyone was running around chaotically. It was busy yes but overly busy to the point where the atmosphere was extremely loud and we were yelling over each other.We finally ordered entrees and again they were slapped on the table as if servers didnt care. Very abrupt. And no one can be bothered for questions. Need more bread? Don't ask. Need more water? Don't askUltimately this was not the place to eat to celebrate the holidays and sadly I won't be coming back.

We ordered:Spanakotiropita - two triangles of paper-thin phyllo wrapped around spinach and cheese. A bit reminiscent of spinach artichoke dip. I'm still impressed by how thin the phyllo was. If only phyllo chips existed. Marithes tiganites - crispy smelts. Considering we had just paid $10 for two fried triangles, we were pleasantly surprised by the small mountain of fried fish we got. The dip looked like garlic but was actually a zesty combination of potato and lemon. Psari psito - wow, a whole fish! It was so tender and fresh. Kokinisto me manestra - lamb shank. The meat fell off the bone and at the touch of my fork. The orzo was buttery and delicious. It was a pretty heavy dish, and I needed my boyfriend's help to eat half of it. Yiaourti - Greek yogurt for dessert. This has ruined all yogurt for me. It was so thick and creamy, topped with soft, sweet dates and drizzled with honey.

The super attentive service, the open kitchen, and the choreography of it all brings together a great setting for delicious food! Make a reservation early--this place is popular for good reason.Evvia's menu consists of a long list of mezedhes (appetizers) and larger entrees. Their entrees are all done simply and are delicious, but I was so much more impressed with their creative small plates, which are perfect for sharing. The soutzoukakia (grilled lamb meatballs) with tomato sauce were so tender and meaty; the taramosalata (fish roe dip) and tzatziki (cucumber/yogurt sauce) with pita were both so creamy and delicious as well. We also had the gigantes (giant baked beans in tomato sauce with feta), the crispy, salty saghanaki cheese, the flavorful and fatty grilled lamb riblets, and best of all, the sliced grilled octopus, which was amazingly tender and popped with fresh flavors.For our entrees, we ordered the grilled pork chop with beans, sausage, tomato, and bell pepper, but the pork chop was slightly overcooked. Far superior was a special they had--a whole roast lamb that was sliced up and seasoned boldly with oregano and olive oil. My goodness--the lamb was fall-apart tender yet bold and gamey at the same time! The dish even came with a piece of crispy lamb skin, along with crispy potato wedges and lemon! Amazing!Finally, we had to close with dessert. There's one thing in particular that's definitely worth getting, and that's the galaktoboureko, a semolina custard wrapped in thin, crispy filo dough and served with homemade pistachio ice cream. Where to start? The semolina custard had the perfect amount of creaminess and sweetness, which contrasted nicely with the crispness of the filo and the crunch of the pistachio chunks in the ice cream! Simply amazing!Yes, this is the place to come if fine dining is on order!

If not for the fact that my girlfriend and I were in the area, I would never have seen this place, and my girlfriend would never had suggested coming here......but I am so glad we discovered it and had the chance to try it out.Very typical looking standalone building, just off the highway style diner, but it was the food that really hits the nail right on the head. We arrived around 11am and the place was already full.....not out-the-door-packed with-a-long-wait full....thank goodness! ...managed to get a pretty nice booth right away.Being a fan of breakfasts, we already had a good idea what we wanted order.....it also helped that they have German pancakes here, which was one of the big reasons why we chose to come dine here. We went ahead and ordered the German Pancake, and an egg white West Coast Omelette ....with sides of hash browns and two pancakes (instead of toast), coffee and tea.Wow....the first thing we notice when the food arrived was they're very big portions.....well worth the price, and second, how perfectly cooked and absolutely yummeeee everything looked! I place great emphasis on a breakfast by how good their hash browns are, and the hash browns here are very good.....not the thin grated potato strands like traditional breakfasts places, but more fettuccine sized strips, perfectly cooked with a lovely soft and fluffy inside and golden brown crisp on top. The omelette was very delicious too....full of ingredients and perfectly fluffy. My girlfriend was first to try the pancakes, and judging from her ""When Harry Met Sally"" at the diner scene look, I knew she had just tasted one of the best pancakes in town. I then took a bite and would have to agree, they were good! Thick, fluffy, and hot off the griddle .....perfect with the warmed syrup that came served with it. Warmed syrup.....love the thought and detail they put into making the pancake experience just perfect. As for the German Pancake.....so soft, moist, and equally as yummy with the warmed syrup, and a dash of fresh squeezed lemon for that yummily perfect pop in the mouth!Everything was so good that we finished every morsel of our yummy breakfast.....even when we couldn't eat anymore, we made the extra effort to finish the last bits of everything....yes, that good. Good thing we were headed to the shopping mall shortly to walk it off.Service was very good too despite the large crowd and hectic pace of serving so many tables.....our server, Francisco, was so nice, polite, attentive, and made sure we were happy and well taken care of throughout.

They're efficient.For food, I like their omelettes, specifically the ham and cheese and they'll give you a mountain of potatoes and toast to go with it. If you're really hungry, you can go the biscuits and gravy route instead or sub for a pancake. I do like their pancakes, but if you order as a stack, it's more like a heap and they'll pile the toppings on high. Be still my fatty heart.As with most diners, the menu is overly extensive.

I am a big breakfast enthusiast, so any recommendations for that food type will peak my interest. Parking: The parking is a little difficult if you get there early in the morning. I came on a Friday at 11 and it was a bit of a struggle. Additionally, if you're considering going on a Sunday there is a church next to this place. So I am guessing that parking will be considerably worse, but still feasible.Service Quality: The was service very fast, surprisingly, considering there were a lot of people. After ordering, it only took about 20 minutes or so to get my food. Carolina was my server and she was more than happy to provide recommendations of what I should get, since it was my first time there. I went with the strawberry stuffed French toast. Food Quality: Man, that recommendation was extremely delicious. It really caught me off guard on how good the French toast was because I love to  eat a lot of French toast (my stomach can vouch for that). The portions were MASSIVE. The coffee was very good as well. It did not taste like your typical diner coffee. Oh, and the orange juice was phenomenal too!Overall: this is a very great place to go eat at.

I had heard that portions are big and they know how to do breakfast. I found the item to order - a country skillet. It would allow me to try the potatoes, gravy and pancakes which should give enough information to know whether I want to come back. The country skillet is described as fried steak pieces and eggs atop biscuits and gravy and potatoes with pancakes on the side. The service was excellent. The restaurant was nicely decorated, clean and well run. The restaurant temperature was way too cold, but the other patrons didn't seem to mind. I imagine that it will heat up when it starts getting busier.The cut up fried steak was just ok. It tasted of well used fryer oil. I would not order it again. The eggs were exactly as I ordered them. The biscuits were under the potatoes and gravy so it was hard to distinguish the two. The biscuits were not the flaky kind but the spongy kind. The gravy was disappointing for a restaurant that specializes in breakfast. There was no detectable animal fat flavor, butter flavor or dairy flavor. The texture was as if it was thickened with starch. The flavors I noticed were salt and pepper. I know it must be hard to do scratch country gravy consistently every day. But I was really hoping for a better gravy here. The pancakes and potatoes were as expected. The warm runny syrup in the oil dispensers at the table was a nice touch!",57,204,1,0,0,4

Warning though, calorie conscious folks might have a problem or two sticking to your plan here. Don't tempt yourself.... or do, like I did.Will be back. Good place to bring family and friends visiting NYC.",289,113,1,1,0,4

I am usually not someone who particularly seeks out for southern food, but everything here is deliiiiiish, from the savoriness and crispiness of the chicken wings, the perfect moist and rich taste of the corn bread, to the millions of dipping sauces that are offered on the table. I see why people would wait for hours just to have a bit of it.Hopes for improvement: wish they have a better way to organize the wait list. The gentleman at the check in mistakenly marked our party as incomplete, which resulted in us waiting for at least 30 minutes more than we should have, only to notice afterwards that many who have come after us were seated before us. The gentleman only never gave us any updates and we had to go in line to talk to him multiple times to make things clear.",18,73,1,0,0,4

The food was exactly as I expected it to be. Delicious and soulful! We ordered the chicken and pancakes (a different spin on chicken and waffles) which was so yummy and fulfilling. We also got the croque madame, which is enough to share among 2 people! It was perfect and cheesy! The customer service was just right.

The pickled mustard seeds were a nice addition to the deviled eggs.  We ordered the Shrimp & Grits, classic Mac & Cheese, and Hot Chicken Biscuit. The shrimp and grits had a nice smokey crayfish flavor in the sauce. It's a delicious dish, but note that the shrimp comes with the shells on.The classic mac & cheese was great! Cheesy and creamy - just what I expect and love about mac and cheese. The hot chicken biscuit was a good dish, but not spectacular. The spicy hot chicken flavor did not come through and the biscuit was a tad dry. Overall, this was a great meal!

This is a really ideal place for an indulgent brunch without all the frills and stuck up atmosphere that you'd find at other places but with HUGE portions for a decent price.My friends and I ordered three dishes (croque madam, bacon egg chicken biscuit, and southern chicken biscuit) as well as an ice coffee and the total came out to be around $75 in total with tax and tip. However the portions were HUGE. You should definitely come with a group of friends and go family style or be prepared to go home with a lot of leftovers (I only managed to eat a 1/3 of my croque madam) but my guy friends managed to finish 3/4 to all of their plates! I think for value, I really liked the croque madam because I got to enjoy their infamous fried chicken and biscuit but also have my egg and ham. Plus I much preferred potatoes to grits. The fried tomatoes were so so on my friend's southern chicken biscuit but the table next to us got this lovely pumpkin biscuit special which I'd love to try next time.

They had given us a table outside, and would be with us in a second. They didn't even give us a menu.

After the walk, they get brunch and tell me all about it. Hello? Where is the invite? One day, I decided to join my friends afterwards around 9 am. The minute I got there, there was already a line. They opened at 9 am and already a line. That already said a lot about the place. My friends and I got two orders of hot fried chicken and shared it. OH MY LORD! I literally found myself greedily grabbing more chicken before I finished the one on my plate. The dish comes with two large juicy chicken pieces perfectly fried after it has been brined in pickle juice and buttermilk. Then, it is doused with a hot sauce elixir that makes the already delicious chicken fabulous! Just when you think things can't get better, they top the chicken with a mound of thinly sliced pickles and serve creamy grits and biscuits on the side. Do yourself a favor and forget about the biscuit/ grits. Yes, they are good, but the chicken is the star and, Jesus Christmas, it is the best fried chicken I ever had. Actually, let's bring the grits/ biscuit back because the hot sauce needs something to sop it up. The thing I like about this dish is that the pickles cut into the greasey/ oily fried chicken so you don't feel so heavy afterwards. It gives you an illusion of lightness, but don't be fooled, it is not. I had this last Sunday and I am already craving it already. My friend took the leftover bits home and I thought she was silly because there wasn't much left, but.... I was a fool. I should have fought her for the bit. So I am on a plane on my way to New Orleans and as I was boarding the plane, I was telling my friend how I wished I had the chicken before we left the city and the lady in front of us was like ""Jacob's Pickle? I love that place!"" We instantly became friends. When you know, you know. BUT! One thing, I got a side of pickled eggs because I thought about my friend's mom who makes bomb pickled eggs. Don't get it. It is a bit off... Hot chicken dish! You will think of me and scatter rose petals wherever I walk for giving you the best advice of all time. For the first time in forever I was excited about a dish. Being a foodie obsessed with how things are made and just having a very particular preference, it is really hard to get me excited about certain things, but this one. Wow! ALSO!

Now the hot chicken biscuit sandwich, the chicken was seasoned and fried well but the sauce this dish uses was very oily and it made the biscuit underneath too greasy to eat.

I'm glad he did because the 3 dishes that we had got were enough for the 4 of us to feel stuffed but happy when we left the restaurant.We ordered the French toast, Croque Madame, and the Sausage Gravy Chicken Biscuit. Each of these dishes had a unique flavor profile to itself, despite having a biscuit in every dish. I've never had a French Toast biscuit before but this was a game changer. The dish already had 4 different pieces of French toast. The outside was nice and crunch with a light sugar powdering, topped with a nice serving of strawberries. Their syrup they have on the table also wasn't too sweet so I didn't feel like it over powered the other flavors. The Croque Madame was huge! The stacked fried egg over the ham, friend buttermilk chicken, over a biscuit with amazing sauce was super delicious. It was a little bit salty, but the flavors really matched. The biscuit they utilized in this dish also had bacon bits cooked within it. This dish also comes with circular cut potatoes, some are thin so it's crunch like a chip but some of the other ones still had the fluffy potato texture.The last dish, the sausage gravy chicken biscuit, is definitely a super comfort food. The gravy itself was rich in flavor and paired well with the spices in the buttermilk chicken. I'm typically not a fan of grits but the way they mixed the cheese into the grits made it really delicious. I would definitely come back here to try their pickles and beer.

It's close to my boyfriend's new apartment and we were hungry so we took the gamble. We came on a Saturday night, right around peak dinner time. Surprisingly, we were seated right away. First and foremost, the food is b.o.m.b [makes bomb sound effects]. I had the Honey Chicken Biscuit [$17] which comes with cheese grits. The farms they source their chickens from must have a workout regime. The piece of buttermilk fried chicken was the biggest I've seen in my life. While it was huge, it was also cooked expertly. It was incredibly juicy on the inside and fried to crispy perfection on the outside. The biscuit it came on, oh boy, that was a flakey, buttery biscuit. Lest I forget, the cheese grits tasted like Thanksgiving mashed potatoes minus the tryptophan-induced coma. This dish is literally all I can think about a few weeks later. My boyfriend had the Chicken & Pancakes [$19]. He said he likes a version of this dish better at The Common in Brooklyn. Idk...his opinion doesn't count [I'm the worst]. I also had a cider, Graft Salt & Sand [$9], which is fruity and acidic. It's nice to drink something refreshing while eating something rich and heavy. He had the root beer, which he enjoyed. I do not like root beer. ___Unfortunately, the air conditioner was not working. It was humid outside and not much better inside, even with the fans blowing. The cooling system dripped on our table as well as the table next to ours. It didn't seem like anyone cared all too much. In any event, we got a free shower. Lucky that my boyfriend and I have been together for awhile. The restaurant is loud and we wouldn't be able to hear each other even if we wanted to. Service wasn't the most attentive as it was busy.

It doesn't just have one piece of fried chicken, but rather two generous slabs, sandwiched between two soft pieces of honey-soaked corn bread. The pickles have a sweet brine and have just a hint of sour to them. After savoring the crispy sweetness of my biscuit sandwich, I found myself admitting defeat and packing most of it to go. The side of cheesy grits also comes in a generous portion, but I don't like grits much and couldn't get on board with them. Even so, this was definitely a meal to remember!",420,164,0,0,0,4

My friend and I went on a Friday night so they were packed but the hostess was very accommodating and texted within 20-25 minutes when a table was ready. The last time I went here I solely ordered the appetizers so I decided to finally try the southern biscuit sandwiches the second time around. We got the fried pickles to start and it was as good as I had remembered it being before. Do take note that the pickles are sliced in the ""long way"" and are thick versus thin circular pieces (pardon my lack of eloquence). In regards to the biscuits, my friend got the hot chicken biscuit and I got the Southern BLT. The portions. Dear god. Trust me when I say that I can eat but even I couldn't finish the whole biscuit. The plate is massive and the sandwich was, quite literally, the size of my face. And yes, portion size is not the only great part about it as it definitely fulfilled that comfort food craving that we have from time to time (or maybe that's just me). If I had to pick between the two, I would definitely go for the hot chicken biscuit instead of the Southern BLT. Not that the Southern BLT is bad, but it just had a little too much going on and lacked flavor (which is why I knocked off a star). The hot chicken, however, was simple (in the sense that it was ""just"" chicken, hot sauce, and pickles) and had a LOT more flavor. If I were to ever go back to Jacob's Pickles, I would definitely order this instead.

Once sat our party ordered 2 appetizers (fried pickles and poutine, both go tos) 3 meals and 3 rounds of drinks.

As if we were not a table of customers who had just ordered $300 worth of food from this establishment. 2 out of three of us work in restaurants and decided that though she handled the situation in the most unprofessional and disrespectful way possible we would finish our drinks, go to the restroom, and head out. While we took turns using the restroom (because we all wanted to finished our drinks as well) this manager made a point of casting is mean looks at us and came over to the table 2 additional times to say that there was a reservation for that table and we needed to leave. Something that would have been fine if we were notified at our seating about a time limit as is customary in most ny restaurants. It literally took one of our party to call her out on her lack of professionalism for her to finally offer us another table if we'd be willing to move (how this entire conversation should have started). As she said this our last person returned from the restroom and we left because there was no way we would be giving this restaurant anymore more money for they way we were treated. If you have a set reservation and want to fill a table before that, I get it. But let your guests know first. That way they can plan their meal around it.

Our wait time was minimal & when we were seated, it was at one of the communal picnic benches in the back room. This restaurant is more spacious than the crowded front bar area lead me to believe. We each ordered a Southern biscuit fried chicken sandwich & soon saw how foolish we had been; the portions are such that three of us could have shared one (not that anyone's counting but this is mistake #2.) $17 each for my Honey Chicken & Pickles and the Hot Chicken Biscuit (you want this Nashville hot sauce!) & $18 for the Southern BLT which stars the incredible fried green tomato. All accompanied by an addictive side of salty, buttery grits. Not ordering some variety of their namesake food (cukes, beets, carrots, jalapeños, even eggs, etc.), thinking the pickles on our sandwiches would suffice -- well, that was my third mistake. As tables received their orders of colorful pickled veggies, I resigned myself to my meal devoid of any pickley assortment. My being a flawed individual benefits you.

My girlfriend had the cheeseburger mac which was also very good (and literally a full cast iron skillet's-worth)Can confirm the portions are massive! Working backwards though, things start going downhill. We tried the deviled eggs and the fried pickles for apps, and they weren't very good. The pickles were way to thinly sliced and all you could taste was the breading. The deviled eggs had a huge amount of yolk (both on top and a bed of it underneath) that was just too much, and it had a gritty texture.

We chose to wait, but at this point have been waiting for over an hour total and are stuck in this terrible spot, becoming frustrated. Why can't people wait outside after they have been texted? We waited an hour and 15 minutes in total to be seated, compared to the 35 minutes we were originally told. I know it's tough to estimate these things, but ths 35 minutes wasn't for our own table and never should have been told to us without noting that. Waiting in the cramped space for about a half hour was also a terrible experience and certainly doesnt help the wait staff Luckily it was worth it for the amazing entree, but my girlfriend and I were frustrated and impatient by the time we were seated.

Also, the table/booth in the front where they sat us was really for 6ppl but they squeezed us in together and we barely had room to move. To top it off, they kept the front doors wide open  and yes, it was 52 degrees earlier that day, but come dinner time it had dropped to 40 and we were freezing our asses off so much we could barely focus on our food. Maybe it was their way of rushing people to leave since it was so crowded??Shrimp and grits were tasty, and my fried chicken was on point.

I've been coming to Joe's since they first opened at Pell Street as a child with my family. Tonight we were surprised at the upgraded restaurant and decor, a big change from the dingy restaurant we've been going to for 20+ years. Everything is new and cleaner looking and the high ceilings and decorative wood decor make this place much more comfortable. Gone are the majority of the large tables which often had   four or more different parties crammed in, replaced by more sensible square tables of 2 or 4 for a more private dining experience. Gone are also the opportunities to chat with tourists and reach across the table to share a bite or two of each other's dish.Is it better? Hard to say. It's definitely more comfortable and LOOKS cleaner. The soup dumplings, the ones we've been eating for 20+ years and what defined my idea of a soup dumpling growing up, has changed somewhat. The skin is thicker (though I have argued it has been thicker for a few years now), the broth thinner with less lip sticking collagen and fat, and the overall soup dumpling (all 4 of the orders we placed) was lukewarm at best, not the same tongue scalding hot as they were at Pell Street. Not sure if this was an opening night fluke or if this will be permanent. Prices are the same as the Pell Street location as it should be since Joe's recently went through significant price hikes a few years ago bringing a regular soup dumpling from $4.95 to $7.95.Scallion pancake also had doubled in price but not quantity or quality and while the fried rice remains the same price, it looks like they changed to smaller serving plates. The szechuan beef noodle soup, never actually spicy, has been put into a larger bowl now. I asked for them to make it extra spicy to get a hint of spice but even that came with a touch of off-putting sweetness. Veggies, particularly snow pea leaves, are deep fried and extremely overpriced for the portion. Recommend everyone stay far away from the vegetables section and eat those elsewhere. Overall the new location looks nice but was not impressed with tonight's soup dumplings or most of the other food. Hope it is just a fluke as they are getting used to the new space and kitchens.P. S. Mandatory tip has now increased from 15% to 18% regardless of party size. Service has improved slightly. Tea and oranges are still free (for now). CASH ONLY",29,81,5,0,1,4

The steamed pork dumplings, despite being $10, really mimicked the ones you could get in a bulk bag at the grocery store. Served with vinegar, it didn't taste bad, but it definitely wasn't super fresh nor mindblowing. I will admit, the soup dumplings were far better and definitely the redeeming factor. They were massive in size and were piping hot and fresh.

The soup is so flavorful and is a little thicker than what I expected. Tasted more like chicken broth, quite oily as well. But sooo worth it! The dumplings costs around $10. They're not stingy with the crab either but be careful when eating this because there might be some shell still in the meat mixture. I crunched on a few. The dumplings of course come with the vinegar soy sauce and ginger as well as chili sauce which had a sour taste to me. We also ordered the pan fried noodles. Light and airy noodles that pop in your mouth with that perfect crunch topped with the thick gravy sauce packed with napa cabbage, your choice of meat, and bean spouts. That being said, the line isn't really worth the wait. We came around on a weekday 1.5 hr before closing so we didn't have a wait.

Saturday afternoon, was able to get a seat at a large communal table without any wait. Most of the main dishes are on the expensive side as they are family-style. Since I didn't have a family with me, I opted instead for the Spring Roll ($2.75) and the Pork Soup Dumplings ($8). While waiting, you are served green tea that's piping hot and good for the stomach. Spring roll is served with a side of soy sauce and stuffed with shrimp and pork. Found it to be overly greasy and not well balanced. The flavor of the shrimp was the saving grace. Soup dumplings come shortly after, several steamed pieces served with soy sauce and ginger. Again, flavor is a little dull - could have used some more spices for the added kick. Towards the last few the dumplings got much colder, so didn't finish the last two.Servers come around often to make sure they get people in and out quickly.

The atmosphere was nice as well as it did not feel too crowded as I am claustrophobic myself so meets my space requirementsWe ordered 4 dishes ( including the soup dumplings) and total damage was in the $50s  with tax and tip, which is normal when dining in Manhattan. It will slightly cheaper if you dine in flushing.  Finally the bathroom was clean as well ( cannot say this about all restaurant in Chinatown) Attached a few pics as well so take your time to have a look Overall, Definitely a good place to bring your friends to for lunch as food is decent and atmosphere is nice. May come back for a second visit. Also would recommend you    Visit early if you're looking to do lunch. The lines here stack up and the wait can be long if you come at the wrong time.",27,26,2,2,0,4

Not sure what's proper but I usually start by placing the soup dumpling on my spoon, pour a little bit of vinegar on it. Then I poke a hole on the bottom of the dumpling and drink the soup!

I started with the pork soup dumplings, which were really good and had a rich, thick and slightly salty broth. I had trouble eating them as they were large but thank goodness I didn't get it on my white shirt. Next I got the shredded pork with dried bean curd and jalapeño. The dish was not spicy at all and was not great. I think it could have benefitted from some more sauce but I also don't like my food on the dry side - personal preference. They end off everybody's meal by brining orange slices before the check. I was stuffed and happy with my meal, and all I wanted was a cold beer to be on my way.

They hyped it up as being the best Greek restaurant in the Bay Area, but I had to make that determination for myself. My boyfriend's birthday was coming up, so I made a reservation at Evvia Estiatorio via OpenTable. I made it a month in advance and quite frankly had no issues with booking the time and date I wanted. It wasn't until I read some of the reviews about Evvia Estiatorio on Yelp after the fact that it was one of those restaurants that had a super long wait to get into (e.g. 3 months in advance). I guess I lucked out!Our dinner reservation was for 6:15pm on a Wednesday. My boyfriend and I were both shocked by how packed the place already was. We were kindly greeted by an older gentleman in a suit, whom I presumed was the owner. Despite the busyness, there were two couples tables readily available. Our host gave us the option to decide which table we wanted, so we took the one located underneath an indoor awning that had a nice overall view of the restaurant. I sat back and took a moment to take in all the sights and sounds. It felt elegant but also casual because of the liveliness and loudness that the guests brought to the space. I liked the simplistic rustic design, open kitchen, and ambient lighting. The customer service was excellent. Our main waiter was friendly, personable, and attentive. The bussers were equally as attentive. They were on top of filling our waters and clearing plates, and they even kept each other in check. There was a point when our food came out, but we didn't get a fresh set of silverware yet. The server who carried our food out would not place the food on our table until we received our silverware. Talk about accountability! Furthermore, the owner did his share of rounds at each table, including ours, to ask if guests were enjoying themselves. My boyfriend and I are not the types to spend hours just hanging around the dinner table. We like to have our meals and then move on to the next thing. We got our appetizers in 5 minutes from ordering, and then received our entrees shortly after. We both appreciated how we finished our entire dinner experience - from getting seated to receiving the bill - in 30 minutes. I'm all about speed and efficiency as long as quality isn't compromised. I truly liked everything I ate at Evvia Estiatorio, and in general I thought that our food was made well and with good ingredients. I love spankopita. These little spinach and feta filled puff pastries are so delightful and my personal favorite Greek appetizers. I absolutely had to order spanakotiropita to share between me and my boyfriend. It came in an order of 2 but rather than serving ourselves, a waiter placed a spanakotiropita on each of our plate. We both agreed that it was the best we've had. The phyllo was flaky, and I loved the generous chunks of feta. The spinach and leeks filling made for a unique blend. Sidenote: I learned something new today. The word, ""spankopita,"" is like a shortened version of the word, ""spanakotiropita."" ""Tiropita"" describes the egg/cheese and can actually be its own standalone puff pastry by the same name. I'll have to try tiropitas next time I see it on a menu. For my entree I ordered moussaka, which is my favorite Greek dish. If you haven't had it before, it's like a Greek lasagna made with egg plant, potatoes, béchamel sauce, and ground lamb or beef (Evvia Estiatorio uses lamb). Admittedly I've had better moussaka elsewhere, but I thought Evvia Estiatorio's version of it was still good. I was definitely satisfied with it. My boyfriend had the Arnisia Paidakia dish consisting of rib-cut, mesquite-grilled lamb chops. I liked the roasted potatoes that complimented the dish. They were thick cuts and nicely crispy on the edges. The lamb chops were hands down the best prepared lamb I've had at a restaurant. The meat was a little bit on the medium well side though my boyfriend asked for medium rare. Nonetheless, the meat was tender, juicy, and flavorful.",431,795,8,5,3,4.5

The crusty outter shell & chewy interior is amazing!! Lamb riblets fell right off the bone and the game-y aspect was very minimal. Crispy calamari was great and complimented well with the  lemon garlic aioli & spicy pepper aioli. Grilled octopus was a miss imo- the super soft texture was not expected and the taste came off very bland. Tzatziki plate was delicious and smearing it on our steak worked out really well ontop of the veggies provided. Ribeye was good but the lamb chops were absolutely the BEST part of the entire meal! Roasted pork was moist and seasoned well, I liked the extra crunchy skin that didn't not taste overwhelming oily. Mushrooms was the second best highlight of the night but buttermilk cake wasn't anything special. All in all, service is very attentive.

Now sure if it's because the place is now super busy, or because many of the amazing servers that used to work here have turned over. However, we've been coming here for 7 years and I can say unequivocally that it was better before. Today, we order two grilled fishes (dorade and branzino) and the lamb (typical for us overindulgent folk) and got great food. However, what has kept us coming back over the years was the formerly great service, which was severely lacking today. Unfortunately, as a young couple of color, I have to wonder whether this is discrimination. In a place which is 90% white and 70% over the age of 40, we were definitely a minority in many regards. The specifics: My water was empty for over an hour. After failing to get anyone's attention, even the guy who was watering tables around us, I drank all of my husband's water and our wine (maybe it was intentional??). Our server was nowhere to be found most of the night. Yet the older white people around me all managed to put in their orders just fine. We order a lot of food-- seriously, probably too much food. But all the tables around us got way better service. The chef came out to chat with many of the tables nearby. By not us, who are regulars. Finally, we were celebrating our anniversary. Usually, for a special occasion, they do the generous and hospitable thing which is give a dessert. Not this time. We got nothing more than a rush to pay the check.

It contained eggplant, lamb, cheese, and potatoes. If you're not too keen on gamey meat, this dish may not be for you as the lamb's flavor was robust. If you don't mind, this is a great filling and hearty dish. Per our server's suggestion, we ended up ordering the custard filled lumpia dish with pistachio ice cream.

We went on a Friday night and it's in downtown Palo Alto so we made reservations a day before (definitely recommend doing that, especially on weekends). We got seated right away, right next to where the fresh free bread gets sliced (comes with salt and olive oil). After looking at reviews and getting recommendations from our waitress, we ordered the rokasalata which was an arugula based salad topped with walnuts, apples, mini blocks of cheese, pomegranate seeds with balsamic vinegar. It was very refreshing and I loved the different crunches to the salad. We also ordered octopus and lamb riblets as appetizers. We considered getting lamb as our main course but we definitely recommend getting lamb as an appetizer because of how strong  of flavor and heavy the meat usually is, and getting a light fish dish as the main! The octopus was delicious, bite sized chewy pieces doused in olive oil and lemon. The lamb riblets were so tender and fell right off the bone. Dipping the bread in both the remnants of the octopus and lamb is a must! The sea bass was the star of the night! We went with the grilled option over oven baked because it came with Swiss chard when grilled which was delicious. What was amazing was that the fish was pulled apart off the bones before it came to our table so didn't have to waste any time picking out little fish bones. It was so flavorful, a good balance of the natural fish flavor and the spices it was cooked in, and wasn't dry at all which I've definitely experienced at other restaurants. Besides the bread, none of the actual dishes we ordered had carbs so we didn't feel sick and stuffed, and got to have tastes of seafood, meat and vegetables!

There was about 11 of us and our waitress kept her poise the entire experience, I understand how challenging it can be with a huge party. We started off with several apps: watermelon salad (it was the special), meatballs, grilled artichoke and eggplant, the octopus (my personal favorite), zucchini balls and calamari. Some dishes we ordered multiple of either because we loved it or there wasn't enough for everyone to try it. The entrees were the main event! The special was the rotisserie pork on a bed of greens, others ordered a ribeye steak and lamb shanks. I ordered the grilled whole fish. It was tasty, but a little dry and be careful of all the bones. I had to order a side of orzo rice on the side to complete the meal (I love me some carbs)! The pork was my favorite dish by far!Desserts was the icing on the cake. We had the custard cannoli thingys served with pistachio ice cream, lave cake with sour cherry ice cream, and baklava with vanilla ice cream. My personal favorite was the custard and baklava! Of course, the ice cream is always a good side for any dessert.Honestly, the food is worth the dining experience. We were the biggest party in the restaurant and it was little tight. I wouldn't recommend a party of 20 unless they have a private room somewhere. This place was outstanding, so glad to have been introduced!",2182,221,2,1,1,4.5

Bottom line: Good to great food with attentive service in a nice atmosphere, but you're going to pay for it.Food: The lamb chops, octopus appetizer, and spanakopita were some of our favorites. Lamb chops were flavorful and tender, octopus was some of the most tender I've had, and spanakopita was very tasty. The braised lamb shank was ok but a little monotonous after a bit. I know the wood grilled branzino gets great reviews but it was a little on the drier and underseasoned side for our tastes and we also found a bone or two which isn't great when you have young kids.Service: Attentive and friendly. GreatAmbiance: Classy yet still comfortable. Lively and bustling but yet cozy and not too loudValue: Evvia is pricey. That being said, you get what you pay for at the end of the day.

The place has a good vibe and is fully of business and tech types entertaining or out for a nicer dinner. People dress up a little more than normal for the Bay Area - a button down is fine and you'd probably be able to get away with a hoodie. We got some complimentary bread and olive oil as we were seated and started with the octopus which had a nice char on it. For mains we got the branzino which they offered to debone for us and the lamb chops - the two most famous dishes in the restaurant. The branzino had great quality fish and a bit of a char but there just wasn't as much flavor as there should have been. It was a little underseasoned. The portion was pretty well sized but more that some small bones still remained (not unexpected though). The lamb chops were fairly well cooked but the meat was a little more grainy than I'd have liked. The cooking developed good flavor but the chops themselves were inconsistent - a couple were far too lean and lacked the juciness of a good lamb chops and another had large amounts of fat. I'd expect for the price point to have better quality cuts of meat. We skipped dessert. Overall, I wouldn't object to coming back if someone else was picking up the tab but I'd spend my own money elsewhere. Everything was fine just overpriced",159,84,5,1,2,4.5

When we asked for recommendations she had none to offer. We ordered appetizers and the individual who placed them on the table didn't say what he was putting in front of us. The servers just slapped the food on the table and walked away. Some appetizers looked similar to others and we weren't sure what we ordered. Then we realized our server had forgotten an appetizer and we were afraid to mention it for fear she would become even more unfriendly. So we held off in mentioning it. Finally the appetizer arrived over 20 minutes later and she had nothing to say.All of this was very odd as this isn't the typical Evvia experience and we were very confused. When we looked around everyone was running around chaotically. It was busy yes but overly busy to the point where the atmosphere was extremely loud and we were yelling over each other.We finally ordered entrees and again they were slapped on the table as if servers didnt care. Very abrupt. And no one can be bothered for questions. Need more bread? Don't ask. Need more water? Don't askUltimately this was not the place to eat to celebrate the holidays and sadly I won't be coming back. My friends and I feel embarrassed about coming here and wish we dined somewhere more friendly. It's simply too busy for any service and I guess a group of 6 is not ideal for this restaurant. We paid $75 a piece without tip and that's not worth it.",29,22,1,0,0,4.5

I made a reservation a week ago, and the earliest opening they had was at 7:45pm, so I showed up hungry and ready to eat my heart out. We ordered:Spanakotiropita - two triangles of paper-thin phyllo wrapped around spinach and cheese. A bit reminiscent of spinach artichoke dip. I'm still impressed by how thin the phyllo was. If only phyllo chips existed. Marithes tiganites - crispy smelts. Considering we had just paid $10 for two fried triangles, we were pleasantly surprised by the small mountain of fried fish we got. The dip looked like garlic but was actually a zesty combination of potato and lemon. Psari psito - wow, a whole fish! It was so tender and fresh. Kokinisto me manestra - lamb shank. The meat fell off the bone and at the touch of my fork. The orzo was buttery and delicious. It was a pretty heavy dish, and I needed my boyfriend's help to eat half of it. Yiaourti - Greek yogurt for dessert. This has ruined all yogurt for me. It was so thick and creamy, topped with soft, sweet dates and drizzled with honey. Good thing my boyfriend was so toasted after the lamb plate that he let me have most of this!It was kind of difficult flagging down our waiter in the beginning, but they were very generous with the bread refills (we may have gone through a whole loaf).",362,686,2,2,0,4.5

The super attentive service, the open kitchen, and the choreography of it all brings together a great setting for delicious food! Make a reservation early--this place is popular for good reason.Evvia's menu consists of a long list of mezedhes (appetizers) and larger entrees. Their entrees are all done simply and are delicious, but I was so much more impressed with their creative small plates, which are perfect for sharing. The soutzoukakia (grilled lamb meatballs) with tomato sauce were so tender and meaty; the taramosalata (fish roe dip) and tzatziki (cucumber/yogurt sauce) with pita were both so creamy and delicious as well. We also had the gigantes (giant baked beans in tomato sauce with feta), the crispy, salty saghanaki cheese, the flavorful and fatty grilled lamb riblets, and best of all, the sliced grilled octopus, which was amazingly tender and popped with fresh flavors.For our entrees, we ordered the grilled pork chop with beans, sausage, tomato, and bell pepper, but the pork chop was slightly overcooked. Far superior was a special they had--a whole roast lamb that was sliced up and seasoned boldly with oregano and olive oil. My goodness--the lamb was fall-apart tender yet bold and gamey at the same time! The dish even came with a piece of crispy lamb skin, along with crispy potato wedges and lemon! Amazing!Finally, we had to close with dessert. There's one thing in particular that's definitely worth getting, and that's the galaktoboureko, a semolina custard wrapped in thin, crispy filo dough and served with homemade pistachio ice cream. Where to start? The semolina custard had the perfect amount of creaminess and sweetness, which contrasted nicely with the crispness of the filo and the crunch of the pistachio chunks in the ice cream! Simply amazing!Yes, this is the place to come if fine dining is on order! The menu prices are relatively high, but certainly worth the quality of fresh ingredients and bold flavors you'll find in every carefully prepared dish!",1145,5763,1,2,0,4.5

We arrived around 11am and the place was already full.....not out-the-door-packed with-a-long-wait full....thank goodness! ...managed to get a pretty nice booth right away.Being a fan of breakfasts, we already had a good idea what we wanted order.....it also helped that they have German pancakes here, which was one of the big reasons why we chose to come dine here. We went ahead and ordered the German Pancake, and an egg white West Coast Omelette ....with sides of hash browns and two pancakes (instead of toast), coffee and tea.Wow....the first thing we notice when the food arrived was they're very big portions.....well worth the price, and second, how perfectly cooked and absolutely yummeeee everything looked! I place great emphasis on a breakfast by how good their hash browns are, and the hash browns here are very good.....not the thin grated potato strands like traditional breakfasts places, but more fettuccine sized strips, perfectly cooked with a lovely soft and fluffy inside and golden brown crisp on top. The omelette was very delicious too....full of ingredients and perfectly fluffy. My girlfriend was first to try the pancakes, and judging from her ""When Harry Met Sally"" at the diner scene look, I knew she had just tasted one of the best pancakes in town. I then took a bite and would have to agree, they were good! Thick, fluffy, and hot off the griddle .....perfect with the warmed syrup that came served with it. Warmed syrup.....love the thought and detail they put into making the pancake experience just perfect. As for the German Pancake.....so soft, moist, and equally as yummy with the warmed syrup, and a dash of fresh squeezed lemon for that yummily perfect pop in the mouth!Everything was so good that we finished every morsel of our yummy breakfast.....even when we couldn't eat anymore, we made the extra effort to finish the last bits of everything....yes, that good.

If you don't get what I'm saying, the portions are massive.What I really love about the restaurant is their ability to flip tables. At any given time, it looks like there is a swarm of people outside (which there is), but getting a table for four even when it's the most crowded during the weekend never seems to be more than 20-minutes. They're efficient.For food, I like their omelettes, specifically the ham and cheese and they'll give you a mountain of potatoes and toast to go with it. If you're really hungry, you can go the biscuits and gravy route instead or sub for a pancake. I do like their pancakes, but if you order as a stack, it's more like a heap and they'll pile the toppings on high. Be still my fatty heart.As with most diners, the menu is overly extensive. I haven't had lunch, but don't feel like I've ever gone wrong with the breakfast.If you want a little extra exhilaration in your life, get seated in a booth next to the main windows.

There was a ton of nuts on the pancakes. A bit too much for my liking. I think that was my only gripe about them. They were cooked with ripe bananas so they did have a nice sweet flavor. My boyfriend's omelette was way better. It was the size of a large burrito you'd get at a Mexican restaurant. The steak had a nice seasoned flavor. I think my only fave had to be the home fries.

The country skillet is described as fried steak pieces and eggs atop biscuits and gravy and potatoes with pancakes on the side. The service was excellent. The restaurant was nicely decorated, clean and well run. The restaurant temperature was way too cold, but the other patrons didn't seem to mind. I imagine that it will heat up when it starts getting busier.The cut up fried steak was just ok. It tasted of well used fryer oil. I would not order it again. The eggs were exactly as I ordered them. The biscuits were under the potatoes and gravy so it was hard to distinguish the two. The biscuits were not the flaky kind but the spongy kind. The gravy was disappointing for a restaurant that specializes in breakfast. There was no detectable animal fat flavor, butter flavor or dairy flavor. The texture was as if it was thickened with starch. The flavors I noticed were salt and pepper. I know it must be hard to do scratch country gravy consistently every day.

You should definitely come with a group of friends and go family style or be prepared to go home with a lot of leftovers (I only managed to eat a 1/3 of my croque madam) but my guy friends managed to finish 3/4 to all of their plates!

After the walk, they get brunch and tell me all about it. Hello? Where is the invite? One day, I decided to join my friends afterwards around 9 am. The minute I got there, there was already a line. They opened at 9 am and already a line. That already said a lot about the place. My friends and I got two orders of hot fried chicken and shared it. OH MY LORD! I literally found myself greedily grabbing more chicken before I finished the one on my plate. The dish comes with two large juicy chicken pieces perfectly fried after it has been brined in pickle juice and buttermilk. Then, it is doused with a hot sauce elixir that makes the already delicious chicken fabulous! Just when you think things can't get better, they top the chicken with a mound of thinly sliced pickles and serve creamy grits and biscuits on the side. Do yourself a favor and forget about the biscuit/ grits. Yes, they are good, but the chicken is the star and, Jesus Christmas, it is the best fried chicken I ever had. Actually, let's bring the grits/ biscuit back because the hot sauce needs something to sop it up. The thing I like about this dish is that the pickles cut into the greasey/ oily fried chicken so you don't feel so heavy afterwards. It gives you an illusion of lightness, but don't be fooled, it is not. I had this last Sunday and I am already craving it already. My friend took the leftover bits home and I thought she was silly because there wasn't much left, but.... I was a fool. I should have fought her for the bit. So I am on a plane on my way to New Orleans and as I was boarding the plane, I was telling my friend how I wished I had the chicken before we left the city and the lady in front of us was like ""Jacob's Pickle? I love that place!"" We instantly became friends. When you know, you know. BUT! One thing, I got a side of pickled eggs because I thought about my friend's mom who makes bomb pickled eggs. Don't get it. It is a bit off... Hot chicken dish! You will think of me and scatter rose petals wherever I walk for giving you the best advice of all time. For the first time in forever I was excited about a dish. Being a foodie obsessed with how things are made and just having a very particular preference, it is really hard to get me excited about certain things, but this one. Wow! ALSO!

They're known for their pickles, the table next to us had an interesting selection, but we'd already stopped at a bakery before breakfast so I knew this wasn't the day for appetizers. I'll certainly give em a go on the next trip.I enjoyed the bacon, egg & cheese biscuit. As you can see by the pic, it's the size of the plate! It's locally sourced, I appreciate that. The bacon is thick-sliced, and smoky--perfect against the creamy texture of the eggs, and the mild buttermilk flavor of the biscuit.The service was perfection, never an empty coffee cup along with great recommendations. This breakfast was a win. I'll do it again. You should, too.",192,236,12,9,3,4

Food was good and expectedly very heavy, however I wasn't impressed.  The food comes out barely warm. I liked their biscuits by itself, the gravy is tasty but I didn't really care for it, but that's a matter of preference as my husband really enjoyed it. Fried pickles are good. Now the hot chicken biscuit sandwich, the chicken was seasoned and fried well but the sauce this dish uses was very oily and it made the biscuit underneath too greasy to eat. The cheddar grits it came with was awfully gelatinous. I would try a different chicken sandwich next time and hopefully this was just a bad batch of grits. I must say the service is phenomenal, especially given how busy it was.",5,141,1,0,0,4

Although we sat down at the large communal table, the spots next to us eventually cleared up. The waiter was really nice in explaining what specials they had, the popular items they have on the menu, and warming us that the portion sizes are pretty big. I'm glad he did because the 3 dishes that we had got were enough for the 4 of us to feel stuffed but happy when we left the restaurant.We ordered the French toast, Croque Madame, and the Sausage Gravy Chicken Biscuit. Each of these dishes had a unique flavor profile to itself, despite having a biscuit in every dish. I've never had a French Toast biscuit before but this was a game changer. The dish already had 4 different pieces of French toast. The outside was nice and crunch with a light sugar powdering, topped with a nice serving of strawberries. Their syrup they have on the table also wasn't too sweet so I didn't feel like it over powered the other flavors. The Croque Madame was huge! The stacked fried egg over the ham, friend buttermilk chicken, over a biscuit with amazing sauce was super delicious. It was a little bit salty, but the flavors really matched. The biscuit they utilized in this dish also had bacon bits cooked within it. This dish also comes with circular cut potatoes, some are thin so it's crunch like a chip but some of the other ones still had the fluffy potato texture.The last dish, the sausage gravy chicken biscuit, is definitely a super comfort food. The gravy itself was rich in flavor and paired well with the spices in the buttermilk chicken. I'm typically not a fan of grits but the way they mixed the cheese into the grits made it really delicious. I would definitely come back here to try their pickles and beer. They have a really amazing selection on the menu that I'm dying to try.",330,43,0,0,0,4

It's close to my boyfriend's new apartment and we were hungry so we took the gamble. We came on a Saturday night, right around peak dinner time. Surprisingly, we were seated right away. First and foremost, the food is b.o.m.b [makes bomb sound effects]. I had the Honey Chicken Biscuit [$17] which comes with cheese grits. The farms they source their chickens from must have a workout regime. The piece of buttermilk fried chicken was the biggest I've seen in my life. While it was huge, it was also cooked expertly. It was incredibly juicy on the inside and fried to crispy perfection on the outside. The biscuit it came on, oh boy, that was a flakey, buttery biscuit. Lest I forget, the cheese grits tasted like Thanksgiving mashed potatoes minus the tryptophan-induced coma. This dish is literally all I can think about a few weeks later. My boyfriend had the Chicken & Pancakes [$19]. He said he likes a version of this dish better at The Common in Brooklyn. Idk...his opinion doesn't count [I'm the worst]. I also had a cider, Graft Salt & Sand [$9], which is fruity and acidic. It's nice to drink something refreshing while eating something rich and heavy. He had the root beer, which he enjoyed. I do not like root beer. ___Unfortunately, the air conditioner was not working. It was humid outside and not much better inside, even with the fans blowing. The cooling system dripped on our table as well as the table next to ours. It didn't seem like anyone cared all too much. In any event, we got a free shower. Lucky that my boyfriend and I have been together for awhile. The restaurant is loud and we wouldn't be able to hear each other even if we wanted to. Service wasn't the most attentive as it was busy. This is definitely not somewhere you want to go on a first date, unless you do not plan on a second one.

My friend and I went on a Friday night so they were packed but the hostess was very accommodating and texted within 20-25 minutes when a table was ready. The last time I went here I solely ordered the appetizers so I decided to finally try the southern biscuit sandwiches the second time around. We got the fried pickles to start and it was as good as I had remembered it being before. Do take note that the pickles are sliced in the ""long way"" and are thick versus thin circular pieces (pardon my lack of eloquence). In regards to the biscuits, my friend got the hot chicken biscuit and I got the Southern BLT. The portions. Dear god. Trust me when I say that I can eat but even I couldn't finish the whole biscuit. The plate is massive and the sandwich was, quite literally, the size of my face. And yes, portion size is not the only great part about it as it definitely fulfilled that comfort food craving that we have from time to time (or maybe that's just me). If I had to pick between the two, I would definitely go for the hot chicken biscuit instead of the Southern BLT. Not that the Southern BLT is bad, but it just had a little too much going on and lacked flavor (which is why I knocked off a star). The hot chicken, however, was simple (in the sense that it was ""just"" chicken, hot sauce, and pickles) and had a LOT more flavor. If I were to ever go back to Jacob's Pickles, I would definitely order this instead.

The waitstaff has always been super cool. That being said tonight's experience has left me never wanting to return. I came in and put my name down for a table of 3. We were told it would be about a 30min wait but we were willing to chill at the bar so nbd. We eventually get our table after a few awkward mix ups with the host (it was super loud and crowded and it was to be expected). Once sat our party ordered 2 appetizers (fried pickles and poutine, both go tos) 3 meals and 3 rounds of drinks. As we were finishing our last round of drinks the manager comes over and word for word says, ""so you guys are going to leave soon right?"" To which we respond, ""yep, just finishing up, we'll be out of here soon"" ""No but like soon, soon"" in a very curt manner. As if we were not a table of customers who had just ordered $300 worth of food from this establishment. 2 out of three of us work in restaurants and decided that though she handled the situation in the most unprofessional and disrespectful way possible we would finish our drinks, go to the restroom, and head out. While we took turns using the restroom (because we all wanted to finished our drinks as well) this manager made a point of casting is mean looks at us and came over to the table 2 additional times to say that there was a reservation for that table and we needed to leave. Something that would have been fine if we were notified at our seating about a time limit as is customary in most ny restaurants. It literally took one of our party to call her out on her lack of professionalism for her to finally offer us another table if we'd be willing to move (how this entire conversation should have started). As she said this our last person returned from the restroom and we left because there was no way we would be giving this restaurant anymore more money for they way we were treated. If you have a set reservation and want to fill a table before that, I get it. But let your guests know first. That way they can plan their meal around it. Telling people ""you have 10mins to finish up and move"" (another direct quote) is not the right way to handle this situation.",2,8,2,0,0,4

I had the erroneous misconception of it being a stodgy, quiet eatery when the opposite is actually true. Jacob's Pickles has a booming energy that spills out onto the street. My first mistake is not coming in sooner. A couple weeks ago I finally decided to try Jacob's Pickles on a Friday evening. Our wait time was minimal & when we were seated, it was at one of the communal picnic benches in the back room. This restaurant is more spacious than the crowded front bar area lead me to believe. We each ordered a Southern biscuit fried chicken sandwich & soon saw how foolish we had been; the portions are such that three of us could have shared one (not that anyone's counting but this is mistake #2.) $17 each for my Honey Chicken & Pickles and the Hot Chicken Biscuit (you want this Nashville hot sauce!) & $18 for the Southern BLT which stars the incredible fried green tomato. All accompanied by an addictive side of salty, buttery grits. Not ordering some variety of their namesake food (cukes, beets, carrots, jalapeños, even eggs, etc.), thinking the pickles on our sandwiches would suffice -- well, that was my third mistake. As tables received their orders of colorful pickled veggies, I resigned myself to my meal devoid of any pickley assortment. My being a flawed individual benefits you. You now know to go to Jacob's Pickles ASAP, share the monster-sized southern biscuit sandwich, & order the pickles. It ain't called Jacob's Pickles for nothing.",203,2186,11,10,10,4

The chicken was rather soggy with the breading falling off and also looked white rather than crispy fried chicken. Seems like the chicken was undercooked. Pancakes were very doughy.. felt like they needed to be left a little longer on the griddle. My boyfriends food was even worse. He got the nashville chicken biscuit. The biscuit was soaked in grease and it was not a biscuit anymore when he went to pick it up. It was a soggy soaked grease piece of biscuit. Horrible food. Waited over an hour to eat junk.

The entrees at Jacob's Pickles were great and I would still highly recommend the place. I had the sausage gravy smothered fried chicken and it was phenomenal. The grits that came as the side were pretty plain and nothing to rave about. My girlfriend had the cheeseburger mac which was also very good (and literally a full cast iron skillet's-worth)Can confirm the portions are massive! Working backwards though, things start going downhill. We tried the deviled eggs and the fried pickles for apps, and they weren't very good. The pickles were way to thinly sliced and all you could taste was the breading. The deviled eggs had a huge amount of yolk (both on top and a bed of it underneath) that was just too much, and it had a gritty texture. When we arrived we were told there would be a 35 minute wait, and recieved a text message after waiting about that long. However, when you are texted and go to the hosts, they have you wait off to the side until your table is actually ready. This is a tiny, cramped area where you are constantly dodging waiters/waitresses while trying not to crowd the people seated around you. We waited for about 10 minutes with two other groups, and were told we could be seated at a table of 6 with 2 other parties, or would need to wait another 15. We chose to wait, but at this point have been waiting for over an hour total and are stuck in this terrible spot, becoming frustrated. Why can't people wait outside after they have been texted? We waited an hour and 15 minutes in total to be seated, compared to the 35 minutes we were originally told. I know it's tough to estimate these things, but ths 35 minutes wasn't for our own table and never should have been told to us without noting that. Waiting in the cramped space for about a half hour was also a terrible experience and certainly doesnt help the wait staff Luckily it was worth it for the amazing entree, but my girlfriend and I were frustrated and impatient by the time we were seated.

The eggs were amazing and the pickles were fried to perfection and the pickles super juicy. For mains I had the hot chicken biscuit and my friend had the fried chicken Cesar. The hot chicken was the perfect amount of spicy and came with cheesy grits (I didn't think I liked grits but I guess I do now).

To describe the Mac n Cheese, my husband said, ""You know how there are some meals where one bit is better than another? Every single bite of this stuff is amazing.""

I've been coming to Joe's since they first opened at Pell Street as a child with my family. Tonight we were surprised at the upgraded restaurant and decor, a big change from the dingy restaurant we've been going to for 20+ years. Everything is new and cleaner looking and the high ceilings and decorative wood decor make this place much more comfortable. Gone are the majority of the large tables which often had   four or more different parties crammed in, replaced by more sensible square tables of 2 or 4 for a more private dining experience. Gone are also the opportunities to chat with tourists and reach across the table to share a bite or two of each other's dish.Is it better? Hard to say. It's definitely more comfortable and LOOKS cleaner. The soup dumplings, the ones we've been eating for 20+ years and what defined my idea of a soup dumpling growing up, has changed somewhat. The skin is thicker (though I have argued it has been thicker for a few years now), the broth thinner with less lip sticking collagen and fat, and the overall soup dumpling (all 4 of the orders we placed) was lukewarm at best, not the same tongue scalding hot as they were at Pell Street. Not sure if this was an opening night fluke or if this will be permanent. Prices are the same as the Pell Street location as it should be since Joe's recently went through significant price hikes a few years ago bringing a regular soup dumpling from $4.95 to $7.95.Scallion pancake also had doubled in price but not quantity or quality and while the fried rice remains the same price, it looks like they changed to smaller serving plates. The szechuan beef noodle soup, never actually spicy, has been put into a larger bowl now. I asked for them to make it extra spicy to get a hint of spice but even that came with a touch of off-putting sweetness. Veggies, particularly snow pea leaves, are deep fried and extremely overpriced for the portion. Recommend everyone stay far away from the vegetables section and eat those elsewhere. Overall the new location looks nice but was not impressed with tonight's soup dumplings or most of the other food. Hope it is just a fluke as they are getting used to the new space and kitchens.P. S. Mandatory tip has now increased from 15% to 18% regardless of party size. Service has improved slightly. Tea and oranges are still free (for now). CASH ONLY",29,81,5,0,1,4

They're not stingy with the crab either but be careful when eating this because there might be some shell still in the meat mixture. I crunched on a few. The dumplings of course come with the vinegar soy sauce and ginger as well as chili sauce which had a sour taste to me. We also ordered the pan fried noodles. Light and airy noodles that pop in your mouth with that perfect crunch topped with the thick gravy sauce packed with napa cabbage, your choice of meat, and bean spouts.

Spring roll is served with a side of soy sauce and stuffed with shrimp and pork. Found it to be overly greasy and not well balanced. The flavor of the shrimp was the saving grace. Soup dumplings come shortly after, several steamed pieces served with soy sauce and ginger. Again, flavor is a little dull - could have used some more spices for the added kick.

But those were probably my favorite items I tried.When we got our check, we got orange slices- the healthiest thing I ate all day.I was glad I got to try it for the experience, I will def have to check out the one in Flushing now, but, I can't go with another group that big, I almost got stuck at the table.  Oh yea, and if you are a germophobe- steer clear of this place, just saying...",1713,1437,5,6,4,4

The pork soup dumplings (8 pieces) are huge! And there's so much fatty, savory soup inside. If this is your first time eating soup dumplings, DO NOT just take a bite out of the dumpling. The soup inside the dumplings is meant to be drained/drank first. I felt that the skin was a little too thick.

But even I have to admit there's only so much pizza a guy can eat before he gets tired of it.Came here around 4 pm on a Saturday afternoon. There was a HUGE crowd of people outside, and I wasn't about to wait longer than 15 minutes to sit down. Thankfully, since I was by myself, I didn't have to wait. Sat down immediately at a shared table, I guess that's just how they do it here with the lack of significant dining space.I only got one thing, the pork meat soup dumplings or xiao long bao. They don't look pretty at all, but they are solid and on par with some of the places back home. They definitely bring the soup in soup dumplings. Trying to eat one of these bad boys in one bite was not a good idea between how big each dumpling was and how hot the soup inside each dumpling was. Pork was fairly run-of-the-mill, nothing overly memorable. Overall, not bad.Service was actually pretty decent for a Chinese place. They're very VERY motivated on one thing, getting you in and out as soon as possible so that they can sit the next party. Joe's is very well-staffed though, so getting someone's attention is not very difficult. And they all speak English, given how many non-Asians pass through here. So yeah, the service is better than your average Chinese place.Personally, I wouldn't go out of my way to come to Joe's Shanghai because there are easily three times as many places back home that sell the same quality of xiao long bao.

The sesame noodles were prepared poorly because of the flavor and the starchiness texture that accentuates the poor flavor. The xiao long bao was okay, as I have tried much better before. You carefully pick up the dumpling and place it in a spoon in case the soup leaks out. This was necessary because these dumplings are relatively large compared to the standard. The soup is pretty good but the pork inside needs improvement as it is not that flavorful. Overall, this place seems to be overhyped and definitely not worth the wait.",348,457,1,0,0,4

Though the skin on the soup dumplings could be a bit thinner for the true soup dumpling texture and taste that I so enjoy, Joe's Shanghai has its own spin on it - there's so much soup packed into each one, and a generous amount of filling/meat in each one too! And at its price in a place like New York (8 soup dumplings for ~$8-9), it really can't get better than this. The scallion pancakes are another favorite dish of mine, partially because of the delicious sweet sauce that they use with it too! They're also really affordable, at around $5 for a stacked plate. Joe's Shanghai has a very modest storefront and only accepts cash, but there's always a line out the door waiting to be seated during peak lunch and dinner hours.

We ordered the crab meat with pork meat soup dumplings, pork meat soup dumplings (classic xiao long bao), and the Shanghai sautéed flat noodles.

Joe's also includes a 15% tip when they give you the check at the end. This place unfortunately only accepts cash though.Another important thing to note about Joe's is that it always tends to be busy. I wouldn't expect any less from such a famous place as this.

They hyped it up as being the best Greek restaurant in the Bay Area, but I had to make that determination for myself. My boyfriend's birthday was coming up, so I made a reservation at Evvia Estiatorio via OpenTable. I made it a month in advance and quite frankly had no issues with booking the time and date I wanted. It wasn't until I read some of the reviews about Evvia Estiatorio on Yelp after the fact that it was one of those restaurants that had a super long wait to get into (e.g. 3 months in advance). I guess I lucked out!Our dinner reservation was for 6:15pm on a Wednesday. My boyfriend and I were both shocked by how packed the place already was. We were kindly greeted by an older gentleman in a suit, whom I presumed was the owner. Despite the busyness, there were two couples tables readily available. Our host gave us the option to decide which table we wanted, so we took the one located underneath an indoor awning that had a nice overall view of the restaurant. I sat back and took a moment to take in all the sights and sounds. It felt elegant but also casual because of the liveliness and loudness that the guests brought to the space. I liked the simplistic rustic design, open kitchen, and ambient lighting. The customer service was excellent. Our main waiter was friendly, personable, and attentive. The bussers were equally as attentive. They were on top of filling our waters and clearing plates, and they even kept each other in check. There was a point when our food came out, but we didn't get a fresh set of silverware yet. The server who carried our food out would not place the food on our table until we received our silverware. Talk about accountability! Furthermore, the owner did his share of rounds at each table, including ours, to ask if guests were enjoying themselves. My boyfriend and I are not the types to spend hours just hanging around the dinner table. We like to have our meals and then move on to the next thing. We got our appetizers in 5 minutes from ordering, and then received our entrees shortly after. We both appreciated how we finished our entire dinner experience - from getting seated to receiving the bill - in 30 minutes. I'm all about speed and efficiency as long as quality isn't compromised. I truly liked everything I ate at Evvia Estiatorio, and in general I thought that our food was made well and with good ingredients. I love spankopita. These little spinach and feta filled puff pastries are so delightful and my personal favorite Greek appetizers. I absolutely had to order spanakotiropita to share between me and my boyfriend. It came in an order of 2 but rather than serving ourselves, a waiter placed a spanakotiropita on each of our plate. We both agreed that it was the best we've had. The phyllo was flaky, and I loved the generous chunks of feta. The spinach and leeks filling made for a unique blend. Sidenote: I learned something new today. The word, ""spankopita,"" is like a shortened version of the word, ""spanakotiropita."" ""Tiropita"" describes the egg/cheese and can actually be its own standalone puff pastry by the same name. I'll have to try tiropitas next time I see it on a menu. For my entree I ordered moussaka, which is my favorite Greek dish. If you haven't had it before, it's like a Greek lasagna made with egg plant, potatoes, béchamel sauce, and ground lamb or beef (Evvia Estiatorio uses lamb). Admittedly I've had better moussaka elsewhere, but I thought Evvia Estiatorio's version of it was still good. I was definitely satisfied with it. My boyfriend had the Arnisia Paidakia dish consisting of rib-cut, mesquite-grilled lamb chops. I liked the roasted potatoes that complimented the dish. They were thick cuts and nicely crispy on the edges. The lamb chops were hands down the best prepared lamb I've had at a restaurant.

Now sure if it's because the place is now super busy, or because many of the amazing servers that used to work here have turned over. However, we've been coming here for 7 years and I can say unequivocally that it was better before. Today, we order two grilled fishes (dorade and branzino) and the lamb (typical for us overindulgent folk) and got great food. However, what has kept us coming back over the years was the formerly great service, which was severely lacking today. Unfortunately, as a young couple of color, I have to wonder whether this is discrimination. In a place which is 90% white and 70% over the age of 40, we were definitely a minority in many regards. The specifics: My water was empty for over an hour. After failing to get anyone's attention, even the guy who was watering tables around us, I drank all of my husband's water and our wine (maybe it was intentional??). Our server was nowhere to be found most of the night. Yet the older white people around me all managed to put in their orders just fine. We order a lot of food-- seriously, probably too much food. But all the tables around us got way better service. The chef came out to chat with many of the tables nearby. By not us, who are regulars. Finally, we were celebrating our anniversary. Usually, for a special occasion, they do the generous and hospitable thing which is give a dessert. Not this time. We got nothing more than a rush to pay the check. Honestly, would not go back despite the great food because I'm not sure why we're being treated this way. Leaves you with a bad feeling",137,190,6,2,2,4.5

I ended up ordering the Moussaka because I was a huge fan of it years ago at Kokkari in SF. The best way to describe the taste is a Mediterranean Shepard's pie. It contained eggplant, lamb, cheese, and potatoes. If you're not too keen on gamey meat, this dish may not be for you as the lamb's flavor was robust. If you don't mind, this is a great filling and hearty dish. Per our server's suggestion, we ended up ordering the custard filled lumpia dish with pistachio ice cream.

We went on a Friday night and it's in downtown Palo Alto so we made reservations a day before (definitely recommend doing that, especially on weekends). We got seated right away, right next to where the fresh free bread gets sliced (comes with salt and olive oil). After looking at reviews and getting recommendations from our waitress, we ordered the rokasalata which was an arugula based salad topped with walnuts, apples, mini blocks of cheese, pomegranate seeds with balsamic vinegar. It was very refreshing and I loved the different crunches to the salad. We also ordered octopus and lamb riblets as appetizers. We considered getting lamb as our main course but we definitely recommend getting lamb as an appetizer because of how strong  of flavor and heavy the meat usually is, and getting a light fish dish as the main! The octopus was delicious, bite sized chewy pieces doused in olive oil and lemon. The lamb riblets were so tender and fell right off the bone. Dipping the bread in both the remnants of the octopus and lamb is a must! The sea bass was the star of the night! We went with the grilled option over oven baked because it came with Swiss chard when grilled which was delicious. What was amazing was that the fish was pulled apart off the bones before it came to our table so didn't have to waste any time picking out little fish bones. It was so flavorful, a good balance of the natural fish flavor and the spices it was cooked in, and wasn't dry at all which I've definitely experienced at other restaurants. Besides the bread, none of the actual dishes we ordered had carbs so we didn't feel sick and stuffed, and got to have tastes of seafood, meat and vegetables! The ambiance is romantic but not to the point where lights are so dimmed and you can't see what you're eating.

Personally, I've always, always been a HUGE fan of their sister-restaurant Kokkari in the city, and been wanting to check this spot out forever. I've honestly never gone to Kokkari for a lunch on my own dime (it was previously company lunches), so I never realized how pricey it can get around here for a salad and hummus side?! Tbh the bud was treating me for my bday, but I caught a glance of the final bill, and shockingly it was over $150. For LUNCH. I wanna say I love Evvia as much as I love Kokkari, and the menu did look almost exactly the same. But the bud and I each got a side salad as our main and asked for added protein, which the waitstaff happily obliged to. The only kicker was that my added salmon was $30+ on top of the nearly $15 mini salad. I meannn that's pretty ridiculous, amirite?!So, again, was the food good? Yes. Was the space nice? Yes.

Some dishes we ordered multiple of either because we loved it or there wasn't enough for everyone to try it. The entrees were the main event! The special was the rotisserie pork on a bed of greens, others ordered a ribeye steak and lamb shanks. I ordered the grilled whole fish. It was tasty, but a little dry and be careful of all the bones. I had to order a side of orzo rice on the side to complete the meal (I love me some carbs)!

The portion was pretty well sized but more that some small bones still remained (not unexpected though). The lamb chops were fairly well cooked but the meat was a little more grainy than I'd have liked.

We had a group of 6 and from the moment we sat down our server was unfriendly, cold and she simply didn't care to serve us. We didn't know what was wrong as we were not a demanding or loud group. We sat quietly and from the moment we arrived we were decisive about what appetizers we wanted to start with. We didn't order a ton of food and none of us had any special requests. It was very straightforward. Yet The server did not bother to greet us, did not smile and didn't want to talk to us. We had to flag her down for water and a glass of wine. When we asked for recommendations she had none to offer. We ordered appetizers and the individual who placed them on the table didn't say what he was putting in front of us. The servers just slapped the food on the table and walked away. Some appetizers looked similar to others and we weren't sure what we ordered. Then we realized our server had forgotten an appetizer and we were afraid to mention it for fear she would become even more unfriendly. So we held off in mentioning it. Finally the appetizer arrived over 20 minutes later and she had nothing to say.All of this was very odd as this isn't the typical Evvia experience and we were very confused. When we looked around everyone was running around chaotically. It was busy yes but overly busy to the point where the atmosphere was extremely loud and we were yelling over each other.We finally ordered entrees and again they were slapped on the table as if servers didnt care. Very abrupt. And no one can be bothered for questions. Need more bread? Don't ask. Need more water? Don't askUltimately this was not the place to eat to celebrate the holidays and sadly I won't be coming back.

We ordered:Spanakotiropita - two triangles of paper-thin phyllo wrapped around spinach and cheese. A bit reminiscent of spinach artichoke dip. I'm still impressed by how thin the phyllo was. If only phyllo chips existed. Marithes tiganites - crispy smelts. Considering we had just paid $10 for two fried triangles, we were pleasantly surprised by the small mountain of fried fish we got. The dip looked like garlic but was actually a zesty combination of potato and lemon. Psari psito - wow, a whole fish! It was so tender and fresh. Kokinisto me manestra - lamb shank. The meat fell off the bone and at the touch of my fork. The orzo was buttery and delicious. It was a pretty heavy dish, and I needed my boyfriend's help to eat half of it. Yiaourti - Greek yogurt for dessert. This has ruined all yogurt for me. It was so thick and creamy, topped with soft, sweet dates and drizzled with honey. Good thing my boyfriend was so toasted after the lamb plate that he let me have most of this!It was kind of difficult flagging down our waiter in the beginning, but they were very generous with the bread refills (we may have gone through a whole loaf).",362,686,2,2,0,4.5

The super attentive service, the open kitchen, and the choreography of it all brings together a great setting for delicious food! Make a reservation early--this place is popular for good reason.Evvia's menu consists of a long list of mezedhes (appetizers) and larger entrees. Their entrees are all done simply and are delicious, but I was so much more impressed with their creative small plates, which are perfect for sharing. The soutzoukakia (grilled lamb meatballs) with tomato sauce were so tender and meaty; the taramosalata (fish roe dip) and tzatziki (cucumber/yogurt sauce) with pita were both so creamy and delicious as well. We also had the gigantes (giant baked beans in tomato sauce with feta), the crispy, salty saghanaki cheese, the flavorful and fatty grilled lamb riblets, and best of all, the sliced grilled octopus, which was amazingly tender and popped with fresh flavors.For our entrees, we ordered the grilled pork chop with beans, sausage, tomato, and bell pepper, but the pork chop was slightly overcooked. Far superior was a special they had--a whole roast lamb that was sliced up and seasoned boldly with oregano and olive oil. My goodness--the lamb was fall-apart tender yet bold and gamey at the same time! The dish even came with a piece of crispy lamb skin, along with crispy potato wedges and lemon! Amazing!Finally, we had to close with dessert. There's one thing in particular that's definitely worth getting, and that's the galaktoboureko, a semolina custard wrapped in thin, crispy filo dough and served with homemade pistachio ice cream. Where to start? The semolina custard had the perfect amount of creaminess and sweetness, which contrasted nicely with the crispness of the filo and the crunch of the pistachio chunks in the ice cream! Simply amazing!Yes, this is the place to come if fine dining is on order!

If not for the fact that my girlfriend and I were in the area, I would never have seen this place, and my girlfriend would never had suggested coming here......but I am so glad we discovered it and had the chance to try it out.Very typical looking standalone building, just off the highway style diner, but it was the food that really hits the nail right on the head. We arrived around 11am and the place was already full.....not out-the-door-packed with-a-long-wait full....thank goodness! ...managed to get a pretty nice booth right away.Being a fan of breakfasts, we already had a good idea what we wanted order.....it also helped that they have German pancakes here, which was one of the big reasons why we chose to come dine here. We went ahead and ordered the German Pancake, and an egg white West Coast Omelette ....with sides of hash browns and two pancakes (instead of toast), coffee and tea.Wow....the first thing we notice when the food arrived was they're very big portions.....well worth the price, and second, how perfectly cooked and absolutely yummeeee everything looked! I place great emphasis on a breakfast by how good their hash browns are, and the hash browns here are very good.....not the thin grated potato strands like traditional breakfasts places, but more fettuccine sized strips, perfectly cooked with a lovely soft and fluffy inside and golden brown crisp on top. The omelette was very delicious too....full of ingredients and perfectly fluffy. My girlfriend was first to try the pancakes, and judging from her ""When Harry Met Sally"" at the diner scene look, I knew she had just tasted one of the best pancakes in town. I then took a bite and would have to agree, they were good! Thick, fluffy, and hot off the griddle .....perfect with the warmed syrup that came served with it. Warmed syrup.....love the thought and detail they put into making the pancake experience just perfect. As for the German Pancake.....so soft, moist, and equally as yummy with the warmed syrup, and a dash of fresh squeezed lemon for that yummily perfect pop in the mouth!Everything was so good that we finished every morsel of our yummy breakfast.....even when we couldn't eat anymore, we made the extra effort to finish the last bits of everything....yes, that good. Good thing we were headed to the shopping mall shortly to walk it off.Service was very good too despite the large crowd and hectic pace of serving so many tables.....our server, Francisco, was so nice, polite, attentive, and made sure we were happy and well taken care of throughout.

They're efficient.For food, I like their omelettes, specifically the ham and cheese and they'll give you a mountain of potatoes and toast to go with it. If you're really hungry, you can go the biscuits and gravy route instead or sub for a pancake. I do like their pancakes, but if you order as a stack, it's more like a heap and they'll pile the toppings on high. Be still my fatty heart.As with most diners, the menu is overly extensive.

I got the breakfast combo and was impressed by the price and amount of food I received. Their portions are huge compare to other breakfast places. They loaded up my plate with potatoes, eggs, bacon strips and a side of pancakes - all for less than $9! The food tasted yummy except for the pancakes.. they were kinda bland and I had to add way more syrup than I normally do. I would probably order a specialty pancake next time I return for more flavor. Service: My bf and I were seated right away, but I saw larger parties waiting. Their service was pretty good and our server checked in on us throughout the meal. My coffee cup was always full.Parking: prepare to wait for a parking space. Again, came here on a weekday but still had to drive around the parking lot for about 10 mins waiting for a spot.",22,9,2,0,0,4

I had heard that portions are big and they know how to do breakfast. I found the item to order - a country skillet. It would allow me to try the potatoes, gravy and pancakes which should give enough information to know whether I want to come back. The country skillet is described as fried steak pieces and eggs atop biscuits and gravy and potatoes with pancakes on the side. The service was excellent. The restaurant was nicely decorated, clean and well run. The restaurant temperature was way too cold, but the other patrons didn't seem to mind. I imagine that it will heat up when it starts getting busier.The cut up fried steak was just ok. It tasted of well used fryer oil. I would not order it again. The eggs were exactly as I ordered them. The biscuits were under the potatoes and gravy so it was hard to distinguish the two. The biscuits were not the flaky kind but the spongy kind. The gravy was disappointing for a restaurant that specializes in breakfast. There was no detectable animal fat flavor, butter flavor or dairy flavor. The texture was as if it was thickened with starch. The flavors I noticed were salt and pepper. I know it must be hard to do scratch country gravy consistently every day. But I was really hoping for a better gravy here. The pancakes and potatoes were as expected. The warm runny syrup in the oil dispensers at the table was a nice touch!",57,204,1,0,0,4

I could honestly eat that banana nut waffle all day with the fresh whipped cream that came on top. The Crab Cake Benedict was so good as well! I think someone may have  accidentally heated the hollandaise sauce improperly as it wasn't emulsified with the butter but nonetheless the crab cakes stayed crisp and were so well complimented with the flavor of the sauce. No regrets!Denver Potato Cakes: Pretty good with the apple sauce. Not our favorite thing on the menu but we didn't regret trying it.Thanks for the great experience and the yummy food.
